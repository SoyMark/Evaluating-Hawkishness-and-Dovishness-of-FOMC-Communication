Vice Chair for Supervision and Chair of the Financial Stability Board Randal K. Quarles

At the Financial Stability Board Roundtable on Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks, Washington, D.C.

I am pleased that we have this opportunity to meet with many of the institutions active in helping to achieve a transition from LIBOR to the risk-free rates identified by working groups in each of our jurisdictions. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has coordinated the international effort to reform interest rate benchmarks at the direction of the G-20. This is an important effort across the globe, but nowhere is it of more importance than in the jurisdictions relying on LIBOR.
