20180321.txt,Good afternoon.,0.459808,0.370481
20180321.txt,"I have a brief statement, and then I’ll be happy to respond to your questions.",0.614361,0.316620
20180321.txt,"The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal.",0.478589,0.843616
20180321.txt,"As you already know, we decided today to raise the target rate  for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1½ to 1¾ percent.1  This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation—a process that has been under way for several years now.",0.673990,0.603400
20180321.txt,"Job gains averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace needed in the longer run to absorb new entrants into the labor force.",0.172939,0.604954
20180321.txt,"The unemployment rate remained low in February at 4.1 percent, while the labor force participation rate moved higher.",0.207290,0.308619
20180321.txt,"Over the past four years, the participation rate has remained roughly unchanged.",0.724648,0.579645
20180321.txt,"That’s a sign of improvement, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate, and we expect that the job market will remain strong.",0.360687,0.658038
20180321.txt,"Although the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have moderat ed early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals underpinning demand remain solid.",0.248823,0.760972
20180321.txt,"Indeed, the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.",0.155792,0.738483
20180321.txt,"Several factors are supporting the outlook:  F iscal policy has become more stimulative, ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence, foreign growth is on a firm trajectory, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.",0.331424,0.784191
20180321.txt,"March 21,

Against this backdrop, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective.",0.659416,0.517347
20180321.txt,"Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 1.7  percent in the 12 months ending in January.",0.165025,0.671381
20180321.txt,"The core price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of futur e inflation, rose 1.5 percent over the same period.",0.301359,0.702474
20180321.txt,"However, as we have noted for some time, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent reflects, at least partly, some unusual price declines that occurred nearly a year ago.",0.599028,0.578889
20180321.txt,"In coming months, as those earl ier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term.",0.315386,0.805133
20180321.txt,"Of course, various forces will continue to affect inflation.",0.747995,0.438968
20180321.txt,"A t times it may be above 2 percent, just as at times  it may be below.",0.665141,0.448764
20180321.txt,Our inflation objective is symmetric in the sense that we are trying to prevent persistent deviations from 2 percent in either direction.,0.777892,0.703314
20180321.txt,"Based on the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, the median project ion for the growth of inflation- adjusted GDP is 2.7 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2020, a bit above its estimated longer -run rate.",0.607757,0.677645
20180321.txt,"The median projection for unemployment —for the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent in the f ourth quarter of this year and runs at 3.6 percent over the next two years, almost a percentage point below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.",0.331643,0.282785
20180321.txt,"Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2020.",0.707946,0.477526
20180321.txt,"Compared with the projections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower, and inflation is slightly higher.",0.406810,0.716723
20180321.txt,"As I noted earlier, today’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is another step in the process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation as the economic expansion

March 21,

continues.",0.743014,0.594515
20180321.txt,"This gradual process has been under way for more than two years , and it has served —and should continue to serve —the economy well.",0.477959,0.669883
20180321.txt,"In making our policy decisions over the next few years, we will continue to aim for inflation of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market.",0.624816,0.773141
20180321.txt,"In the Committee’s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these goals.",0.578553,0.809102
20180321.txt,"By contrast, raising rates too slowly  would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion.",0.386686,0.428574
20180321.txt,"At the same time, we want to avoid inflation running persistently below our  objective, which could leave us with less scope to counter an economic downturn in the future.",0.453815,0.392763
20180321.txt,Participants’ projections of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflect our gradual approach.,0.768391,0.476033
20180321.txt,"The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of this year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020.",0.695196,0.335325
20180321.txt,"By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer -run trend.",0.543628,0.748702
20180321.txt,"Most participants revised up their projections since Decembe r, although the median projection for this year did not change.",0.651209,0.441415
20180321.txt,The medians for 2019 and 2020 are somewhat higher than in December.,0.428737,0.702103
20180321.txt,"Of course, we’ll be watching how the economy evolves in the months and years ahead relative to our maximum employment and p rice stability objectives.",0.758068,0.498855
20180321.txt,"If the outlook changes, we will adjust monetary policy appropriately.",0.845640,0.528165
20180321.txt,"Finally, I’ll note that our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in October, is proceeding smoothly.",0.452966,0.751503
20180321.txt,"Barring a very significant and unexpected weakening in the outlook, we do not intend to alter this program.",0.694911,0.431808
20180321.txt,"As we’ve said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.",0.802267,0.414733
20180321.txt,"As always, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions

March 21,

were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.",0.771430,0.621952
20180321.txt,"Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions now.",0.559587,0.316882

20180321.txt,"Mr. Chairman —rig ht, the microphone.",0.515769,0.088706
20180321.txt,"Mr. Chairman, welcome.",0.502400,0.213182
20180321.txt,Interesting changes in the forecast.,0.569399,0.398044
20180321.txt,"A higher growth forecast a full point above the long run, lower unemployment seven -tenths  below the long run, a nd yet very little change in inflation.",0.556042,0.714918
20180321.txt,What does that say ab out what you and the Committee believe about the inflation dynamic ?,0.640829,0.182388
20180321.txt,"And how is it that, in that context, you justify three rate hikes this year —and I sense there’ll be three next year —and a full $600 billion, I guess, annual rate decline in the balance sheet?",0.413298,0.292014
20180321.txt,Where's your biggest concern here?,0.514690,0.091617
20180321.txt,Is it in overkill when it comes to rates or underkill?,0.596942,0.147691
20180321.txt,CHAIRMAN POWELL.,0.497449,0.112670
20180321.txt,"So, you’re right that the outlook did improve, as I mentioned and as you—as was in your question.",0.366516,0.665964
20180321.txt,"The Committee ’s estimates of growth went u p, the Committee ’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation.",0.491710,0.388464
20180321.txt,"And I think that reflects, essentially —if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent.",0.383318,0.259659
20180321.txt,It’s now 4.1 percent.,0.429617,0.408746
20180321.txt,You ’ve only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.,0.554554,0.566938
20180321.txt,And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.,0.663857,0.560276
20180321.txt,"But, it has diminished, but it ’s still there.",0.513141,0.401721
20180321.txt,"So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will.",0.646453,0.330911
20180321.txt,STEVE LIESMAN.,0.481762,0.015618
20180321.txt,"And your biggest concern or your biggest risk here —is it doing too much, doing too little?",0.505015,0.144228
20180321.txt,"CHAIRMAN POWEL L.  You know, I think we ’re trying to, we ’re trying to be, to take the middle ground there.",0.602839,0.383538
20180321.txt,"So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too

March 21,

long, and then we have to raise rates quickly , and that foreshortens the expansion.",0.693963,0.558541
20180321.txt,We don’ t want to do that.,0.569453,0.155016
20180321.txt,"The —on the other side, if we —if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then, really doesn ’t get sustainably up to 2 percent , and, that will hurt us going forward.",0.325670,0.338242
20180321.txt,"We need that, and it ’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expecta tions are anchored at 2  percent .",0.722912,0.561715
20180321.txt,"So we ’re trying to take that middle ground, and the Committee continues to believe that the middle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the economy is broadly on this path.",0.701565,0.741770
20180321.txt,NICK TIMIRAOS.,0.469041,0.014151
20180321.txt,Thanks.,0.500434,0.319605
20180321.txt,I’m Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.,0.477738,0.044490
20180321.txt,"Chair Powell, I want to ask about the symmetric inflation target—what you outlined in your remarks as preventing persistent deviations.",0.765383,0.466577
20180321.txt,I want to understand what symmetry means in the  context of inflation b eing allowed to run above the 2 percent  target now that that ’s part of the projection for—at least for core PCE next year.,0.733729,0.545069
20180321.txt,How do you define symmetric relative to the experience of the past five years?,0.621886,0.206371
20180321.txt,Would the Fed be willing to a ccept the type of overshoot of its target as it has seen during the undershoot?,0.721139,0.458798
20180321.txt,And how high above 2 percent is too high to maintain a target that is symmetric?,0.668334,0.331483
20180321.txt,"Is it 2¼, 2½, 2¾ ?",0.481893,0.092621
20180321.txt,"And also, for how long?",0.518753,0.052336
20180321.txt,CHAIRMAN POWELL.,0.497449,0.112670
20180321.txt,"You know, so as you noted, the —what we ’ve said in the longer -run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below.",0.742401,0.470686
20180321.txt,We ’ve also said —in minutes and in speeches and things like that —that  that is a symmetric objective.,0.666313,0.340144
20180321.txt,"So, that ’s how we think of it.",0.605315,0.138113
20180321.txt,"And, I think it ’s—I wouldn’ t characterize what we ’ve done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation.",0.651481,0.555611
20180321.txt,"We were always pushing toward 2 percent , and I think that is how we look at it.",0.702331,0.469502
20180321.txt,I can ’t give you an exact number.,0.541657,0.039082
20180321.txt,"It just, you know, it, we haven ’t agreed on that.",0.581359,0.204102
20180321.txt,"It just is that we ’re always going to be seeking 2 percent

March 21,

inflation.",0.679779,0.324336
20180321.txt,"And in doing that, we ’re going to be considering, by the way , the other side of the mandate.",0.681581,0.419712
20180321.txt,"You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from — unemployment from its goal.",0.663393,0.492514
20180321.txt,"And —and also , just the duration of it as well.",0.599706,0.111100
20180321.txt,JIM PUZZANGHERA.,0.466463,0.031903
20180321.txt,"Hi, Mr. Chairman.",0.497929,0.280639
20180321.txt,"Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Time s.  Even with the extra fiscal stimulus of the tax cuts, your median growth projection is just up to 2.7 percent, and then—this year —and then drops back down to 2 percent by 2020.",0.636980,0.360490
20180321.txt,Is the continued talk in Washington about tax cuts bring ing growth to 3 per cent or higher on a sustained basis overselling their potential impact?,0.444018,0.554746
20180321.txt,CHAIRMAN POWELL.,0.497449,0.112670
20180321.txt,"You know, let me say what that really is.",0.560733,0.092581
20180321.txt,So the Summary of Economic Projections  is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts.,0.591337,0.041070
20180321.txt,"The C ommittee made really  one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",0.681410,0.559252
20180321.txt,The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down.,0.569351,-0.010180
20180321.txt,"And, you ’ve identified the median as 2.7 percent .",0.594303,0.277472
20180321.txt,I would—and that ’s an interesting statistic .,0.582060,0.351032
20180321.txt,I would also say that the central tendency is interesting.,0.672127,0.377337
20180321.txt,The full range is interesting.,0.580563,0.266036
20180321.txt,So you have a range of views around the table.,0.570880,0.186874
20180321.txt,"One of the great benefits of our system is that we do have R eserve Banks with their own s taffs and Governors with different views , and so we discuss these things.",0.649936,0.381295
20180321.txt,"So the C ommittee doesn ’t vote or agree upon the medians, so you ’re going to have a range of views.",0.623851,0.178804
20180321.txt,"That ’s really all I can say —2.7 just happens to be the median for ’ 18, but it doe sn’t really say, you know, what we think is possible.",0.598028,0.227968
20180321.txt,JIM PUZZANGHERA.,0.466463,0.031903
20180321.txt,But do you think you can get to 3 percent on a sustained basis?,0.540201,0.526677
20180321.txt,CHAIRMAN POWELL.,0.497449,0.112670
20180321.txt,"You know, I would say it ’s hard to say, but it would take —you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long -run growth.",0.610559,0.546868
20180321.txt,"It

March 21,

would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to get there.",0.488522,0.677791
20180321.txt,JEANNA SMIALEK.,0.470217,0.014406
20180321.txt,"Hi, Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg New s.  So obviously you guys reduced your NAIRU  estimate s slightly  today, but if you continue to see job gains around 200,000 a month, primary labor participation rising slightly, pretty sustainably, you know, moderate wage increases, at what point are you guys going to start to question whether y ou’re actually overshooting full employment?",0.294768,0.416922
20180321.txt,"And, if you start to question that, how is that going to impact policy?",0.593592,0.180935
20180321.txt,CHAIRMAN POWELL.,0.497449,0.112670
20180321.txt,So I guess I ’d start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.,0.631445,0.224212
20180321.txt,"We look at a wide range of indicators on that —you know, 15 or 20 of them at least .",0.622253,0.257816
20180321.txt,"And also, I think we all understand that any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands .",0.703733,0.321180
20180321.txt,"So as the —as the actual unemployment rate has declined  from 10 perce nt to 4.1 percent , the Committee ’s median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point.",0.247731,0.297780
20180321.txt,"So the Committee —and , I think, people —are generally influenced by data.",0.658353,0.265110
20180321.txt,"As they see unemployment going lower, they ’re loo king at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation.",0.480089,0.195583
20180321.txt,"So I don’ t think we, we —we ’re mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we ’ll be looking at that.",0.675302,0.357059
20180321.txt,"So, as —if inflation —if unemployment does continue to go down, we ’ll continue to do that.",0.567380,0.532541
20180321.txt,"As I mentioned earlier, there is no —there’ s no sense in the data that we ’re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.",0.474901,0.529862
20180321.txt,"We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that.",0.386560,0.725269
20180321.txt,We’ll be alert to that.,0.681562,0.413410
20180321.txt,"I guess the idea —the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained

March 21,

period, you would see an acceleration of inflation.",0.578797,0.522725
20180321.txt,"So we would know that then, a nd we ’re very alert to it, but it’ s not something we observe at the present.",0.663970,0.182942

20180321.txt,Thanks very much.,0.479522,0.392963
20180321.txt,Sam Fleming from Financial Times.,0.416080,0.100530
20180321.txt,You and other policymakers have talked about headwinds turning into tailwinds recently.,0.510888,0.338190
20180321.txt,"Does that imply that you think now a higher neutral rate of interest is operative in the U.S. economy, and how would you assess the implications for monetary policy?",0.705607,0.478749
20180321.txt,"And s econd question—this is obviously your first press conference, so it ’s a little early to ask this question, but would you like to do this more ofte n?",0.576899,0.189676

20180321.txt,So they don’ t—they don’t  move around very much.,0.533686,0.044303
20180321.txt,"So I wouldn’ t expect the Committee ’s, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to move quickly.",0.670627,0.265669
20180321.txt,They ’ll move slowly.,0.648154,0.316571
20180321.txt,"So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would move up because of, for example, greater fiscal expan sion?",0.563372,0.655180
20180321.txt,There’ s literature that says that.,0.550540,0.184919
20180321.txt,There’s —there are reasons that that might be the case.,0.618905,0.350795
20180321.txt,"In fact, it did tick  up one -tenth , as you all know, in the —in the median at this time.",0.398587,0.567311
20180321.txt,"But it’ s—I think, generally speaking, the Committee sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not—is not seeing it as having moved up and is open to the possibility that it will.",0.714621,0.601770

20180613.txt,"But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain -English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the Federal Rese rve are trying to do, and why.",0.670521,0.212552
20180613.txt,The main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well.,0.378084,0.704852

20190619.txt,I’d like to step back and review how the changing economic and financial picture brings us to today’s decision.,0.753986,0.464910

20191030.txt,"Good afternoon , and welcome.",0.393004,0.457957
20191030.txt,My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.,0.542528,0.323408
20191030.txt,We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals that Congress has given us :  maximum employment and stable prices.,0.654239,0.582439
20191030.txt,We ’re committed to making the best decisions we can based o n facts and objective analysis.,0.658273,0.456927
20191030.txt,Today we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year.,0.557680,0.464192
20191030.txt,We took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks.,0.517159,0.760938
20191030.txt,"As I will explain shortly, the policy adjustments we have made since last year are providing —and will continue to provide —meaningful support to the economy.",0.529499,0.708438
20191030.txt,We believe that mone tary policy is in a good place.,0.535900,0.668527
20191030.txt,"The U.S. economy is in its 11th year of expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable.",0.356845,0.759968
20191030.txt,The overall economy is growing at a moderate rate.,0.419849,0.657226
20191030.txt,"Household spending continues to be strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.",0.280192,0.708311
20191030.txt,"In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year.",0.126396,0.109509
20191030.txt,Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.,0.226847,0.233978
20191030.txt,"Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a moderate rate, reflecting solid household spending and s upportive financial conditions.",0.230112,0.753081
20191030.txt,The job market remains strong.,0.235544,0.689360
20191030.txt,The unemployment rate has been near h alf-century lows for a year and a half.,0.105481,0.148212
20191030.txt,The pace of job gains has eased this year but has remained solid ; we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace.,0.202165,0.514944
20191030.txt,"Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increas ing, a nd wages have been rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs.",0.120441,0.340699
20191030.txt,"People who live and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better

chapters to their liv es.",0.529242,0.414646
20191030.txt,This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market rea ches more of those left behind.,0.502538,0.641101
20191030.txt,Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.,0.410937,0.278393
20191030.txt,"Over the 12 months through August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent.",0.625862,0.297304
20191030.txt,"Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges.",0.474770,0.402135
20191030.txt,We’re mindful  that continued below -target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in long- term inflation expectations.,0.278344,0.259408
20191030.txt,"However, against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent.",0.233472,0.788619
20191030.txt,"Overall, we  continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely.",0.493565,0.846336
20191030.txt,"While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that wil l best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.",0.706129,0.624453
20191030.txt,"As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks.",0.329572,0.323184
20191030.txt,"These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures , have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year.",0.386809,0.252441
20191030.txt,"In both July and September, we reduced the target rate [range] for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and we did so again today, bringi ng the range to 1½  to 1¾ percent.",0.584762,0.524391
20191030.txt,The policy adjustments  we’ve made to date will continue to provide significant support for the economy.,0.353411,0.761148
20191030.txt,"Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time.",0.767362,0.543427
20191030.txt,"We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.",0.553263,0.853672
20191030.txt,"We believe monetary policy

October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

is in a good place to achieve these outcomes.",0.539098,0.695135
20191030.txt,"Looking ahead, we ’ll be monitoring the effects of our policy actions, along with other information bearing on the out look, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate.",0.777669,0.483346
20191030.txt,"Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.",0.722504,0.500866
20191030.txt,Po licy is not on a preset course.,0.672555,0.195787
20191030.txt,Let me end with a few  words about our technical monetary policy operations.,0.654650,0.247318
20191030.txt,"In January, we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime.",0.774549,0.657996
20191030.txt,"In that operating framework, we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting our admi nistered rates, not through frequent interventions to actively manage the supply of reserves.",0.748774,0.324754
20191030.txt,"In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in our balance sheet in March and we stopped it in July.",0.644791,0.528052
20191030.txt,"In response to the funding pressures in money markets that emerged in mid- September, we concluded that it would be  appropriate to maintain , over a time —over time , a level of reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September of this year.",0.632054,0.800124
20191030.txt,"To achieve this ample level, we announced on October 11 that we would purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year as well as conti nue temporary open market  opera tions at least through January.",0.626810,0.505333
20191030.txt,These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves.,0.714932,0.536898
20191030.txt,They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.,0.698463,0.294106
20191030.txt,"In particular, our Treasury bill purchases should not be confused with the large -scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis.",0.634366,0.278418
20191030.txt,"In those programs, we purchased longer -term securities to  put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions.",0.662897,0.653080
20191030.txt,"In contrast,

October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

increasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short -term assets held by the public and should not materially a ffect demand and supply for longer -term securities or financial conditions more broadly.",0.726931,0.530588
20191030.txt,Thank you.,0.520864,0.334204
20191030.txt,I will be happy to take your questions.,0.576029,0.283583
20191030.txt,MICHAEL MCKEE.,0.494046,0.059414
20191030.txt,Michael McK ee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.,0.459573,0.065455
20191030.txt,"So I guess the question is , is this it?",0.523302,0.079867
20191030.txt,Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough now to achieve your goal of sustaining the expansion?,0.589604,0.582304
20191030.txt,"And as  far as global Wall Street’ s primary question, what kind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess —some sort of sig nificant deterioration in what?",0.607499,0.273092
20191030.txt,CHAIR POWELL.,0.436572,0.061725
20191030.txt,"So what we ’ve said, to repeat , is that we see the current stance of policy as “ likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook.”   And we say that, really, becau se both of the performance of the economy and the stance of policy.",0.723607,0.566768
20191030.txt,"The performance of the economy has been —particularly the household sector —has been strong, has been resilient , with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, l abor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending.",0.254642,0.747911
20191030.txt,"The manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing , and also investment and exports have been weaker.",0.116248,0.137782
20191030.txt,"But, overall, we ’ve seen moderate gro wth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up.",0.338547,0.760897
20191030.txt,We see the outlook a s for more of the same.,0.639933,0.534594
20191030.txt,"We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting  period, although, some remain —some things remain to be seen.",0.591718,0.673505
20191030.txt,So that ’s the economy.,0.575481,0.183920
20191030.txt,"Turning to policy, we ’ve moved the stance of policy over  the course of the year to a more accommodative stance, and , after the cuts a t the last three meetings, the federal funds r ate is now

in a range between 1 ½ and 1¾ percent .",0.756128,0.535606
20191030.txt,We feel that policy is well positioned to support the outlook that I described.,0.556249,0.676747
20191030.txt,"So you asked what it would take, you know, to move, and, as I mentioned, we ’re going to be watching all factors ,  And if developments emerge that c ause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.",0.750594,0.535735
20191030.txt,But that ’s what it would take:  a materi al reassessment of our outlook.,0.669319,0.392123
20191030.txt,MICHAEL MCKEE.,0.494046,0.059414
20191030.txt,"If I could follow up—i f the markets decide that you need to cut rates again , will you be for ced to follow?",0.655227,0.406962
20191030.txt,CHAIR POWELL.,0.436572,0.061725
20191030.txt,"We’ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about the risks to the outlook, and I ’ve given you a sense of what our outlook is.",0.636885,0.377416
20191030.txt,"It’ s for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 perce nt objective.",0.692947,0.713035
20191030.txt,"If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that ’s what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy.",0.718613,0.313024
20191030.txt,HEATHER LONG.,0.453865,0.036089
20191030.txt,"Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post .",0.430758,0.139226
20191030.txt,You just said that the risks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction.,0.563412,0.612899
20191030.txt,"I’m wondering if you could specify—is that on trade , or are there other matters?",0.589981,0.088192
20191030.txt,"This morning we obviously learned that we ’ve now had two quarters of contracting business investment , which would seem to be moving the outlook in the other direction.",0.573987,0.627498
20191030.txt,CHAIR POWELL.,0.436572,0.061725
20191030.txt,"So , in terms of risks, what I was referring to there —the principal risks that we ’ve been monitoring have been, really , slowing global growth  and trade policy developments  as well as muted inflat ion pressure.",0.629242,0.519272
20191030.txt,So  I was really referring there to trade developments.,0.629454,0.240125
20191030.txt,"We have that phase -one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put into effect , could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and re ducing uncertainty, and that would bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time.",0.374678,0.754611
20191030.txt,"So  that has

October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

the potential for being an improvement in the risk picture.",0.431138,0.723498
20191030.txt,"Brexit , I would say, as well —it appears that the risk of a no -deal Brexit seems to have materially declined.",0.342719,0.519089
20191030.txt,"I think on both situations there ’s plenty of risk left, but I’ d have to say that t he risks seem to have subsided.",0.430879,0.556320
20191030.txt,"You asked  about business investment, and that ’s right.",0.558210,0.244526
20191030.txt,"Business investment has been weak , and t oday ’s reading was weak as well .",0.057360,0.041972
20191030.txt,And it was broad acro ss equipment and other parts of—all parts of business fixed investment were weak.,0.177178,0.064611
20191030.txt,"That ’s consistent with what we ’ve seen, but that ’s the economy we ’ve had this year.",0.623439,0.439123
20191030.txt,"What we ’ve had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth , and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent  in this quarter —in this first reading for the quarter.",0.568407,0.366104
20191030.txt,"So, overall, we see the economy as having been resilient to the —you know, the winds that have been blowing this year.",0.574188,0.752831
20191030.txt,HEATHER LONG.,0.453865,0.036089
20191030.txt,Can I just follow up quickly?,0.571336,0.191894
20191030.txt,"I mean , there ’s this concern that I sometimes hear that , with business , businesses have cut investment , and are they going to turn around and cut employment?",0.256790,0.158758
20191030.txt,"You know, sort of , if they continue to be concerned.",0.600072,0.219046
20191030.txt,Can  you give a sense of how the C ommittee is thinking—thi nking through that possibility?,0.633481,0.253135
20191030.txt,CHAIR POWELL.,0.436572,0.061725
20191030.txt,"Yes, so that is a risk.",0.618348,0.410689
20191030.txt,"That ’s a risk that we’ ve been monitoring, but we don’ t see it yet.",0.657615,0.327700
20191030.txt,We don’ t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that.,0.335810,0.108612
20191030.txt,"But the risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing— in export investment , business investment , parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don ’t see that.",0.650394,0.341296
20191030.txt,What we continue to see is good job creation.,0.449934,0.586267
20191030.txt,"U nemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50- year low —has been, you know, very close to 50- year low s for 18 months now.",0.254594,0.225129
20191030.txt,So it ’s very positive.,0.509711,0.483051
20191030.txt,"The consumer -facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on,

October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

you know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that ’s their principle focus.",0.614208,0.496742
20191030.txt,"So that is the thing that ’s pushing the economy forward, and it doesn’ t seem to have been affected so far by weakness in the other areas.",0.541532,0.578398
20191030.txt,JEANNA SMIALEK.,0.470217,0.014406
20191030.txt,Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.,0.438794,0.115700
20191030.txt,Thanks for taking our questions.,0.512412,0.336265
20191030.txt,"So you’ ve previously sort of  compared this rate -cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in the ’90s, and in both of those instances, the Greenspan F ed took those cuts back after a while.",0.644608,0.460724
20191030.txt,They raised rates again fairly quickly.,0.540187,0.680314
20191030.txt,And I guess I ’m just curious what the onus is for doing that in this cycle.,0.667612,0.257099
20191030.txt,Wh at would make you guys decide it ’s appropriate to raise interest rates again?,0.527598,0.369926
20191030.txt,CHAIR POWELL.,0.436572,0.061725
20191030.txt,"So the reason why we raised interest rates is because —generally is because we see inflation as moving up —or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don’t see that now.",0.548504,0.646672
20191030.txt,Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.,0.257838,0.385288
20191030.txt,"We thought that that was due , to some extent , to idiosyncratic or transient  factors.",0.621148,0.225405
20191030.txt,"That turns out to have been the case, so it ’s moved back up.",0.542547,0.578494
20191030.txt,But it seems to be settling in below 2  percent .,0.459851,0.283174
20191030.txt,So we really don’ t see that risk .,0.638941,0.278834
20191030.txt,"And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways —both surveys and market based over the course of this —of, really , the recent mont hs.",0.499332,0.279222
20191030.txt,"And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we ’re strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent  inflation objective on a symmetric basis.",0.683433,0.679838
20191030.txt,We think it ’s essential that we do that.,0.650698,0.463870
20191030.txt,So we ’re not thinking about raising rates right now.,0.675081,0.351271
20191030.txt,There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate.,0.730314,0.509856
20191030.txt,"What we ’re really thinking now is that our current stance

October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

of policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in  keeping with our expectations.",0.721451,0.640277
20191030.txt,STEVE LIESMAN.,0.481762,0.015618
20191030.txt,"Mr. —Steve Liesman, CNBC.",0.479313,0.060335
20191030.txt,"Mr. Chairman, I ’m—not to make light of it, but I ’m a little bit— I wonder if you could help me out with the appropr iate understanding of the word “appropriate”  here.",0.582850,0.310992
20191030.txt,S o the statement says  that the Committee  is going “to monitor the implications of incoming information for the outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range.,0.761329,0.412028
20191030.txt,”  That tells me you could go either way.,0.583078,0.418370
20191030.txt,"You  came in , and you used the word “ appropr iate,” that the current rate is “likely to remain appropriate ,” which means you’ re on hold.",0.489145,0.253363
20191030.txt,"So how do I walk away from this, and what should we walk away from this believing what “ appropriate ” means?",0.617822,0.212952
20191030.txt,"Are you on hold and need to be proved wrong that you should rem ain on hold, or is it , really , you could go either way here?",0.438948,0.081240
20191030.txt,Thank you.,0.520864,0.334204
20191030.txt,CHAIR POWELL.,0.436572,0.061725
20191030.txt,"So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate —likely to remain appropriate —as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent .",0.504120,0.827172
20191030.txt,That’s—so that ’s what we’ re saying about that.,0.600938,0.263643
20191030.txt,"We also say, of course, if developments emerge that cause a  material reassessment of that outlook, we would respond accordingly.",0.719591,0.520662
20191030.txt,So that ’s really how we ’re thinking about it.,0.615647,0.183537
20191030.txt,I can ’t point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds.,0.625415,0.208434
20191030.txt,"It really —it would be a reassessment of —a material reassessment  of our overall outlook, which is what I described.",0.666189,0.275464

20241107.txt,Sure.,0.528740,0.284571
20241107.txt,"So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions.",0.742012,0.421971

20241107.txt,"Here , we don’ t know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be.",0.686927,0.193398

20241107.txt,"Given that you’ ve said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now dialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U .S.",0.665111,0.460584

20241107.txt,"I will say, though, that it appears that the moves are not , not principally about higher inflation expectations .",0.673000,0.372484
20241107.txt,They’re really about a sense of more likely  to have stronger growth and perhaps less in the way of downside risks.,0.628879,0.515307
20241107.txt,So that ’s what they’ re about.,0.583663,0.149905

20250129.txt,Good afternoon .,0.459808,0.370481
20250129.txt,My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people .,0.574378,0.668612
20250129.txt,The economy is strong—is strong  overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years .,0.276089,0.709385

20250129.txt,I’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments .,0.684527,0.331390

20250129.txt,"Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has stabilized since the middle of last year and , at 4.1 percent in December, remains low .",0.234322,0.324609
20250129.txt,"Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed .",0.225548,0.613296

20250129.txt,The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures .,0.765521,0.456381

20250129.txt,That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light of the progress on inflation and the rebalancing in the labor market .,0.742018,0.707494
20250129.txt,"With our policy stance significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance .",0.819139,0.652843
20250129.txt,"At today ’s meeting, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal fund s rate at 4 ¼ to 4 ½ percent .",0.808150,0.450793
20250129.txt,We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation .,0.395364,0.305119
20250129.txt,"At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment .",0.288536,0.298132

20250129.txt,"If the economy remains —economy remains  strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can

maintain policy restraint for longer.",0.760918,0.630979
20250129.txt,"If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly.",0.774638,0.656548
20250129.txt,Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate .,0.669597,0.569157
