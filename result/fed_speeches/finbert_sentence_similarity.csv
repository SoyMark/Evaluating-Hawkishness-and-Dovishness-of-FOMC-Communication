Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal K. Quarles

At the American Bar Association Banking Law Committee Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C.",0.545814,0.195694
20180119.txt,It is a pleasure to be here with you at the American Bar Association banking law committee annual meeting.,0.510922,0.286459
20180119.txt,"1 Thank you to Meg Tahyar, my longtime friend and colleague, for inviting me to speak today.",0.435720,0.396225
20180119.txt,These are still the early days of my tenure at the Federal Reserve--last weekend marked my first three months as the first Vice Chairman for Supervision.,0.627459,0.290938
20180119.txt,"In those three months, people have had a lot of questions for me, but the most frequently asked question has been: What's next?",0.561640,0.150103
20180119.txt,Today I hope to give you some insights into how I am approaching the work of evaluating and improving the post-crisis regulatory regime and to outline some specific areas that are emerging as areas of focus early in my tenure.,0.617338,0.425620
20180119.txt,"Some of those areas are closer to being ready for action, while others are topics that I believe are important and would benefit from more attention and discussion.",0.641282,0.483680
20180119.txt,My hope is that you will come away from our time together with a better sense of my preliminary thinking for charting a course forward on financial regulation.,0.551328,0.519369
20180119.txt,"Efficiency, Transparency, and Simplicity of Regulation Before I delve into specifics, let me say a few words about the principles that are guiding my approach to evaluating changes to the current regime.",0.636346,0.280002
20180119.txt,"The body of post-crisis financial regulation is broad in scope, complicated in detail, and extraordinarily ambitious in its objectives.",0.648749,0.308746
20180119.txt,"Core aspects of that project have resulted in critical gains to our financial system: higher and better quality capital, an innovative stress testing regime, new liquidity regulation, and improvements in the resolvability of large firms.",0.272087,0.676313
20180119.txt,We undoubtedly have a stronger and more resilient financial system due in significant part to the gains from those core reforms.,0.358063,0.726331
20180119.txt,"These achievements are consistent with the responsibility of the Federal Reserve to be a steward of a safe financial system, and with the goal of maintaining the ability of banks to lend through the business cycle.",0.524904,0.637560
20180119.txt,"That said, the Federal Reserve and our colleagues at other agencies have now spent the better part of the past decade building out and standing up the post-crisis regulatory regime.",0.611255,0.497485
20180119.txt,"At this point, we have completed the bulk of the work of post-crisis regulation, with an important exception being the U.S. implementation of the recently concluded Basel III ""end game"" agreement on bank capital standards at the Basel Committee.",0.668633,0.434499
20180119.txt,"As such, now is an eminently natural and expected time to step back and assess those efforts.",0.670320,0.642659
20180119.txt,"It is our responsibility to ensure that they are working as intended and--given the breadth and complexity of this new body of regulation--it is inevitable that we will be able to improve them, especially with the benefit of experience and hindsight.",0.470790,0.672190
20180119.txt,"In undertaking this review and assessment, in addition to ensuring that we are satisfied with the effectiveness of these regulations, I believe that we have an opportunity to improve the efficiency, transparency, and simplicity of regulation.",0.442889,0.664783
20180119.txt,By efficiency I mean the degree to which the net cost of regulation--whether in reduced economic growth or in increased frictions in the financial system--is outweighed by the benefits of the regulation.,0.646858,0.551045
20180119.txt,"In other words, if we have a choice between two methods of equal effectiveness in achieving a goal, we should strive to choose the one that is less burdensome for both the system and regulators.",0.710398,0.516887
20180119.txt,Efficiency of regulation can be improved through a variety of means.,0.560574,0.547312
20180119.txt,"For example, it can mean achieving a given regulation's objective using fewer tools.",0.649888,0.319358
20180119.txt,It can mean addressing unintended adverse consequences to the industry and the broader public from a regulation or eliminating perverse incentives created by a regulation.,0.641892,0.348056
20180119.txt,It can mean calibrating a given regulation more precisely to the risks in need of mitigation.,0.714954,0.323659
20180119.txt,"It can also mean simpler examination procedures for bank supervisors, or less intrusive examinations for well managed firms.",0.644717,0.268528
20180119.txt,"In our approach to assessing post-crisis regulation, we should consider all of these ways of improving efficiency.",0.625147,0.530305
20180119.txt,Transparency is an objective that ought to particularly resonate with this audience.,0.627408,0.441172
20180119.txt,"As lawyers, we were all trained to view transparency as a necessary precondition to the core democratic ideal of government accountability--the governed have a right to know the rules imposed on them by the government.",0.648354,0.321511
20180119.txt,"In addition, as any good lawyer also recognizes, there are valuable, practical benefits to transparency around rulemaking; even good ideas can improve as a result of exposure to a variety of perspectives.",0.489820,0.575253
20180119.txt,"Finally, simplicity of regulation is a principle that promotes public understanding of regulation, promotes meaningful compliance by the industry with regulation, and reduces unexpected negative synergies among regulations.",0.648652,0.484295
20180119.txt,Confusion that results from overly complex regulation does not advance the goal of a safe system.,0.642601,0.303265
20180119.txt,"Common Ground Areas of Improvement When I arrived at the Federal Reserve, the early stages of reflection on how to improve the cost-benefit balance of post-crisis regulation had already begun, mainly in a few narrow areas of focus.",0.632510,0.431425
20180119.txt,These were areas of low-hanging fruit in which relatively broad consensus was reached that efficiency enhancements were available with no material cost to the resiliency or resolvability of the banking system.,0.558792,0.711393
20180119.txt,"My colleague and Chairman-nominee Jay Powell spoke about five of these areas last summer when he served as the Board's oversight governor for supervision and regulation: small bank capital simplification, burden reduction in resolution planning, enhancements to stress testing, leverage ratio recalibration, and Volcker rule simplification.",0.624750,0.326006
20180119.txt,"2 I wholeheartedly support these initiatives, and I am pleased that some of them have progressed even in the months since the summer.",0.366005,0.671879
20180119.txt,"The banking agencies recently proposed changes to the capital rules for smaller firms, consistent with last year's Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act report, which is a positive step toward meaningful burden relief for smaller banks.",0.508769,0.722708
20180119.txt,"3 The Federal Reserve, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, extended the upcoming resolution planning cycles for the eight most systemic domestic banking firms and for foreign banks with limited U.S. operations in order to allow for more time between submissions.",0.642171,0.499763
20180119.txt,"4 I believe we should continue to improve the resolution planning process in light of the substantial progress made by firms over the past few years, including a permanent extension of submission cycles from annual to once every two years and reduced burden for banking firms with less significant systemic footprints.",0.399095,0.762185
20180119.txt,"And, most recently, the Federal Reserve released a package of proposed enhancements to the transparency of our stress testing program, which is currently out for comment.",0.586283,0.500565
20180119.txt,5 The progress you have seen in those areas represents constructive early steps.,0.419606,0.621606
20180119.txt,"Leverage ratio recalibration also is among the Federal Reserve's highest-priority, near-term initiatives.",0.653298,0.640497
20180119.txt,"We have made considerable progress on that front in the past few months, and I expect that you will see a proposal on this topic relatively soon.",0.619282,0.532639
20180119.txt,"Finally, the relevant agencies have begun work on a proposal to streamline the Volcker rule.",0.625040,0.441611
20180119.txt,This project is a quite comprehensive and substantial undertaking as well as a five-agency endeavor.,0.581890,0.422454
20180119.txt,"As such, it will naturally take a bit of work for the agencies to congeal around a thoughtful Volcker rule 2.0 proposal for public review.",0.690633,0.375832
20180119.txt,Volcker rule reform remains a priority in the Federal Reserve's regulatory efforts.,0.681534,0.580913
20180119.txt,"Emerging Areas for Review With that update on the familiar, I will turn to my own impressions of what is next for post-crisis regulation.",0.641409,0.236241
20180119.txt,"In my early days as the Vice Chairman for Supervision, I asked our staff to conduct a comprehensive review of the regulations in the core areas of reform that I outlined earlier--capital, stress testing, liquidity, and resolution.",0.644858,0.413495
20180119.txt,"The objective is to consider the effect of those regulatory frameworks on resiliency and resolvability of the financial system, on credit availability and economic growth, and more broadly to evaluate their costs and benefits.",0.680433,0.399073
20180119.txt,"This is a comprehensive and serious process, and work is still underway.",0.600046,0.516998
20180119.txt,"I should note, however, that I have already formed views on a few areas that warrant more focus, and that I will be working with my colleagues on the Board to constructively consider.",0.587352,0.632961
20180119.txt,"I will start with the issue of tailoring supervision and regulation to the size, systemic footprint, risk profile, and business model of banking firms.",0.655094,0.258870
20180119.txt,"The Federal Reserve has devoted considerable energy in its post-crisis regulatory work to incorporate the tailoring concept in its regulation and supervision across the spectrum of small, medium, and large firms.",0.635145,0.426089
20180119.txt,A recent example of this approach is our late 2017 proposal to simplify capital requirements for small- and medium-sized banking firms.,0.694332,0.453966
20180119.txt,"In my view, there is further work for the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies to do on the tailoring front.",0.727065,0.532255
20180119.txt,I would emphasize that tailoring is not an objective limited in scope to a subset of the smallest firms.,0.659872,0.253648
20180119.txt,"As my colleagues and I have said before, the character of our regulation should match the character of the risk at the institution.",0.679051,0.350859
20180119.txt,"Accordingly, we should also be looking at additional opportunities for more tailoring for larger, non-Global Systemically Important Banks, or non-G-SIBs.",0.490070,0.624581
20180119.txt,"In this regard, I support congressional efforts regarding tailoring, whether by raising the current $50 billion statutory threshold for application of enhanced prudential standards or by articulating a so-called factors-based threshold.",0.649530,0.523638
20180119.txt,"Irrespective of where the legislative efforts land, I believe we at the Federal Reserve have the responsibility to ensure that we do further tailoring for the institutions that remain subject to our rules to ensure that regulation matches the risk of the firm.",0.726331,0.459684
20180119.txt,Take for example large non-G-SIBs whose failure would not individually pose a risk to U.S. financial stability.,0.630450,0.322464
20180119.txt,"Even without financial stability implications, the distress or failure of these firms still could harm the U.S. economy by, for example, significantly disrupting the flow of credit to households and businesses.",0.206753,0.057737
20180119.txt,"In my view, this tranche of the U.S. banking system ought to be subject to regulations that are generally stricter than those that apply to small banking firms, but that are also meaningfully less strict than those that apply to the G-SIBs.",0.751653,0.406874
20180119.txt,The Board has effected this sort of G-SIB versus non-G-SIB tailoring among large banks in many areas of the regulatory framework.,0.694283,0.533271
20180119.txt,"Most notably, each of the risk-based capital requirements, leverage requirements, stress testing requirements, and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements is calibrated substantially more strictly for G-SIBs than for large non-G-SIBs.",0.669130,0.392523
20180119.txt,"However, in some key regulations, there is no distinction between the requirements for large non-G-SIBs and G-SIBs.",0.686916,0.242796
20180119.txt,"Liquidity regulation, for example, does not have a G-SIB versus non-G-SIB gradation.",0.671991,0.191640
20180119.txt,"In particular, the full liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement and internal stress testing requirements of enhanced prudential standards apply to large, non-G-SIB banks in the same way that they apply to G-SIB banks.",0.662746,0.326690
20180119.txt,"I believe it is time to take concrete steps toward calibrating liquidity requirements differently for large, non-G-SIBs than for G-SIBs.",0.673122,0.641882
20180119.txt,And I see prospects for further liquidity tailoring in that the content and frequency of LCR reporting are the same for the range of firms currently subject to the modified LCR as they are for the large non-G-SIBs that are subject to the full LCR.,0.692304,0.453774
20180119.txt,"We should also explore opportunities to apply additional tailoring for these firms in other areas, such as single counterparty credit limits and resolution planning requirements.",0.604045,0.517335
20180119.txt,"Another area that I think we should revisit are the ""advanced approaches"" thresholds that identify internationally active banks.",0.666153,0.381514
20180119.txt,"These thresholds are significant not only for identifying which banking firms are subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements, but also for identifying which firms are subject to various other Basel Committee standards, such as the supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, and the LCR.",0.666045,0.364802
20180119.txt,"The metrics used to identify internationally active firms--$250 billion in total assets or $10 billion in on-balance-sheet foreign exposures--were formulated well over a decade ago, were the result of a defensible but not ineluctable analysis, and have not been refined since then.",0.632564,0.221051
20180119.txt,We should explore ways to bring these criteria into better alignment with our objectives.,0.563483,0.620545
20180119.txt,A third area in which I will be working with my Board colleagues is a meaningful simplification of our framework of loss absorbency requirements.,0.631276,0.392331
20180119.txt,There are different ways to count the number of loss absorbency constraints that our large banking firms face--which is perhaps in itself an indication of a surfeit of complexity if we can't be perfectly sure of how to count them--but the number I come up with is 24 total requirements in the framework.,0.629591,0.158477
20180119.txt,"While I do not know precisely the socially optimal number of loss absorbency requirements for large banking firms, I am reasonably certain that 24 is too many.",0.703471,0.317402
20180119.txt,Candidates for simplification include: elimination of the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements; one or more ratios in stress testing; and some simplification of our TLAC rule.,0.665190,0.375077
20180119.txt,"I am not the first Federal Reserve governor to mention some of these possibilities, and we should put them back on the table in the context of a more holistic discussion of streamlining these requirements.",0.726262,0.417275
20180119.txt,"Let me be clear, however, that while I am advocating a simplification of large bank loss absorbency requirements, I am not advocating an enervation of the regulatory capital regime applicable to large banking firms.",0.724143,0.334436
20180119.txt,"Although not a post-crisis regulation, the Board's complex and occasionally opaque framework for making determinations of control under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) is another area that is ripe for re-examination through the lenses of efficiency, transparency, and simplicity.",0.685982,0.387208
20180119.txt,"As you know, a determination of control under the BHC Act is significant because even remote entities in a controlled group can be subject to the BHC Act's restrictions on activities and a host of other regulatory requirements.",0.652845,0.161016
20180119.txt,Under the Board's control framework--built up piecemeal over many decades--the practical determinants of when one company is deemed to control another are now quite a bit more ornate than the basic standards set forth in the statute and in some cases cannot be discovered except through supplication to someone who has spent a long apprenticeship in the art of Fed interpretation.,0.601732,0.118131
20180119.txt,The process can be burdensome and time-consuming both for the requester and Federal Reserve staff.,0.433454,0.115768
20180119.txt,We are taking a serious look at rationalizing and recalibrating this framework.,0.654802,0.478893
20180119.txt,"Finally, as I mentioned earlier, an enhanced stress testing transparency package was released for public comment last month.",0.600587,0.370295
20180119.txt,I personally believe that our stress testing disclosures can go further.,0.580241,0.589514
20180119.txt,"I appreciate the risks to the financial system of the industry converging on the Federal Reserve's stress testing model too completely, so I am hesitant to support complete disclosure of our models for that reason.",0.689293,0.337578
20180119.txt,"However, I believe that the disclosure we have provided does not go far enough to provide visibility into the supervisory models that often deliver a firm's binding capital constraint.",0.717270,0.343577
20180119.txt,"It is important in any proposal to receive comments, and I can say that I and my colleagues on the Board will be paying particularly close attention to your comments on how we might improve this current proposal.",0.649314,0.493605
20180119.txt,"Concluding Remarks To conclude, I hope that these remarks give you a sense of our approach to analyzing and improving post-crisis regulation.",0.567319,0.449474
20180119.txt,"As I mentioned earlier, the areas of core reform--capital, liquidity, stress testing, and resolution--have produced a stronger and more resilient system and should be preserved.",0.488512,0.687229
20180119.txt,"We have made great progress, but there is further work to do.",0.536643,0.616386
20180119.txt,Some clear improvements are in the offing in the relatively near future.,0.369998,0.740747
20180119.txt,Other areas will benefit from longer term discussion.,0.597989,0.429196
20180119.txt,I look forward to engaging with you and the public more broadly as I help to chart a course for the important work ahead.,0.537481,0.498715

20180417.txt,"First, we should seek to modernize the definition of assessment areas in such a way that the core focus remains the credit needs of local communities.",0.656344,0.449212
20180417.txt,"The definition in the existing CRA regulation of a bank's assessment area--that is, the area in which we evaluate a bank's CRA performance--reflects a banking environment when interstate banking was not yet allowed, and physical branches were necessary to serve the deposit and lending needs of bank customers.",0.704727,0.245920
20180417.txt,"Technological advances and changing consumer preferences have made it possible for banks to serve customers far outside of their physical branches--for example, online and on mobile devices.",0.472869,0.453288
20180417.txt,"Clearly, it is time to find a way to expand the area in which the agencies evaluate a bank's CRA activities.",0.596215,0.500842
20180417.txt,"At the same time, it is important to retain a focus on place--and in particular the credit needs of local communities.",0.719897,0.495196
20180417.txt,We are confident that there are ways to expand the area where we evaluate a bank's CRA performance without losing the regulation's focus on the unique role banks play in meeting local credit needs and providing services that are only possible by using branches.,0.528107,0.593985
20180417.txt,"Treasury's recommendation that the agencies revisit the regulations to allow CRA consideration for a bank's activities in its assessment area, as currently delineated around branches and deposit-taking automated teller machines, as well as in low- and moderate-income areas outside that branch footprint, is a reasonable place to start our interagency discussions.",0.664351,0.427556
20180417.txt,"Second, banks should be encouraged to seek opportunities in areas that are underserved.",0.538518,0.647207
20180417.txt,"Currently, a bank's performance in its major markets is evaluated most closely and weighs most heavily in its CRA rating.",0.657176,0.440101

20180417.txt,We should not adopt a set of evaluation criteria that would be appropriate for large banks and assume that smaller community banks would be able to meet them without substantial additional burden.,0.768423,0.497091
20180417.txt,"We should also be sensitive to the ways in which a bank's business strategy, no matter its size, influences the types of activities it undertakes to meet its CRA obligations.",0.712818,0.292035
20180417.txt,Regulatory revisions that do not contemplate evaluating CRA performance in context risk undermining CRA's greatest attribute--its recognition that banks are uniquely situated to be responsive to the most impactful community and economic development needs in communities.,0.573990,0.645732
20180417.txt,"Fourth, we should seek greater consistency in examinations and ratings across the agencies as well as within each agency.",0.674375,0.535108
20180417.txt,"Clarity about the activities that qualify for CRA consideration, the area in which those activities will be considered, and the type of demographic and economic information examiners evaluate will go a long way toward promoting consistency.",0.594488,0.492443
20180417.txt,"In addition to regulatory revisions, however, the agencies can promote consistency in other, non-regulatory ways.",0.666608,0.531886
20180417.txt,"For example, we can improve the way in which examiners present their analysis in written performance evaluations and provide more opportunities for interagency examiner training.",0.460217,0.537657
20180417.txt,"Fifth and finally, revised regulations should support CRA's position as one of several mutually reinforcing laws designed to promote an inclusive financial services industry.",0.491467,0.634542
20180417.txt,"As banks seek to meet the credit needs of their entire community, it is important to ensure against discriminatory or unfair and deceptive lending practices.",0.714001,0.467537
20180417.txt,"In the months ahead, I look forward to receiving input from the many stakeholders about the path forward on modernizing CRA regulations.",0.573965,0.515450
20180417.txt,I want to express my commitment to supporting the goals of CRA as we revise the regulations to better align them with current banking practices.,0.608665,0.561656
20180417.txt,"In closing, I want to express my appreciation to you for inviting me to join you today.",0.477292,0.392032

20180504.txt,"One important issue for us at the Fed, and the one that I will spend some time reflecting on today, is how post-crisis financial regulation, through its incentives for bank behavior, may influence the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in the long run.",0.739530,0.410744
20180504.txt,"Obviously, the whole excessively kaleidoscopic body of financial regulation is admittedly difficult to address in the time we have today, so I will focus on a particular component -- the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR--and its link to banks' demand for U.S. central bank reserve balances.",0.692675,0.282708
20180504.txt,"Besides illuminating this particular issue, I hope my discussion will help illustrate the complexities associated with the interconnection of regulatory and monetary policy issues in general.",0.647909,0.442458
20180504.txt,"Also, let me emphasize at the outset that I will be touching on some issues that the Board and the FOMC are in the process of observing and evaluating and, in some cases, on which we may be far from reaching any final decisions.",0.731330,0.394730
20180504.txt,"As such, my thoughts on these issues are my own and are likely to evolve, benefiting from further discussion and our continued monitoring of bank behavior and financial markets over time.",0.641411,0.480930

20180504.txt,"As I have said previously, I view promoting the safety, soundness, and efficiency of the financial system as one of the most important roles of the Board.",0.654262,0.402378
20180504.txt,Improving efficiency of the financial system is not an isolated goal.,0.640117,0.448087

20180504.txt,"Take, for example, the Board's two most recent and material proposals, the stress capital buffer and the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR).",0.654355,0.423360
20180504.txt,"The proposal to modify the eSLR, in particular, initially raised questions in the minds of some as to whether it would reduce the ability of the banking system to weather shocks.",0.582898,0.530342
20180504.txt,A closer look at the proposal shows that the opposite is true.,0.652274,0.385365
20180504.txt,The proposed change simply restores the original intent of leverage requirements as a backstop measure to risk-based capital requirements.,0.650303,0.392317
20180504.txt,"As we have seen, a leverage requirement that is too high favors high-risk activities and disincentivizes low-risk activities.",0.501761,0.182866
20180504.txt,We had initially calibrated the leverage ratio at a level that caused it to be the binding constraint for a number of our largest banks.,0.718157,0.539454
20180504.txt,"As a result, those banks had an incentive to add risk rather than reduce risk in their portfolios because the capital cost of each additional asset was the same whether it was risky or safe, and the riskier assets would produce the higher return.",0.682457,0.483463
20180504.txt,The proposed recalibration eliminates this incentive by returning this leverage ratio to a level that is a backstop rather than the driver of decisions at the margin.,0.695604,0.562459
20180504.txt,"Yet, because of the complex way our capital regulations work together--with risk-based constraints and stress tests regulating capital at both the operating and holding company levels--this improvement in incentives is obtained with virtually no change in the overall capital requirements of the affected firms.",0.499064,0.721419

20180504.txt,2 So this recalibration is a win-win: a material realignment of incentives to reduce a regulatory encouragement to take on risk at a time when we want to encourage prudent behavior without any material capital reduction or cost to the system's resiliency.,0.715698,0.581533
20180504.txt,"Taken together, I believe these new rules will maintain the resiliency of the financial system and make our regulation simpler and more risk sensitive.",0.568564,0.651353
20180504.txt,Liquidity Regulations Let me now back up to the time just before the financial crisis and briefly describe the genesis of liquidity regulations for banks.,0.602062,0.145526

20180504.txt,"They perform this function in part through the mechanism of maturity transformation--that is, taking in short-term deposits, thereby making a form of short-term, liquid investments available to households and businesses, while providing longer-term credit to these same entities.",0.581917,0.248449
20180504.txt,"This role, however, makes banking firms vulnerable to the potential for rapid, broad-based outflows of their funding (a so-called run), and these institutions must therefore balance the extent of their profitable maturity transformation against the associated liquidity risks.",0.598599,0.506336
20180504.txt,"3 Leading up to the 2007-09 financial crisis, some large firms were overly reliant on certain types of short-term funding and overly confident in their ability to replenish their funding when it came due.",0.427508,0.252130
20180504.txt,"Thus, during the crisis, some large banks did not have sufficient liquidity, and liquidity risk management at a broader set of institutions proved inadequate at anticipating and compensating for potential outflows, especially when those outflows occurred rapidly.",0.309006,0.194429
20180504.txt,"4

In the wake of the crisis, central banks and regulators around the world implemented a combination of regulatory reforms and stronger supervision to promote increased resilience in the financial sector.",0.369605,0.715781

20180504.txt,5 The LCR rule requires covered firms to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA)ââin terms of both quantity and qualityââto cover potential outflows over a 30-day period of liquidity stress.,0.658945,0.371891

20180504.txt,Large banks have adjusted their funding profiles by shifting to more stable funding sources.,0.644747,0.628043
20180504.txt,"Indeed, taken together, the covered banks have reduced their reliance on short-term wholesale funding from about 50 percent of total assets in the years before the financial crisis to about 30 percent in recent years, and they have also reduced their reliance on contingent funding sources.",0.535338,0.565599
20180504.txt,"Meanwhile, covered banks have also adjusted their asset profiles, materially increasing their holdings of cash and other highly liquid assets.",0.291938,0.737435

20180504.txt,"6 A sizable portion of these assets currently consists of U.S. central bank reserve balances, in part because reserve balances, unlike other types of highly liquid assets, do not need to be monetized, but also, importantly, because of the conduct of the Fed's monetary policy, a topic to which I will next turn.",0.685260,0.286918

20180504.txt,"With this backdrop, a relevant question for monetary policymakers is, what quantity of central bank reserve balances will banks likely want to hold, and, hence, how might the LCR affect banks' reserve demand and thereby the longer-run size of the Fed's balance sheet?",0.720327,0.361460
20180504.txt,Let me emphasize that policymakers have long been aware of the potential influence that regulations may have on reserve demand and thus the longer-run size of the Fed's balance sheet.,0.777104,0.514157
20180504.txt,"And, of course, regulatory influences on banks' behavior, my focus today, is just one of many factors that could affect policymakers' decisions regarding the appropriate long-run size of the Fed's balance sheet.",0.690682,0.239074
20180504.txt,"7 In particular, in augmenting its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the FOMC stated in June 2017 that it ""currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis"" and went on to note that ""the level will reflect the banking system's demand for reserve balances and the Committee's decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the future.""",0.576007,0.528416

20180504.txt,A key takeaway from this figure is that the Fed was in the process of adding substantial quantities of reserve balances to the banking system while the LCR was being implementedââand these two changes largely happened simultaneously.,0.717603,0.488750
20180504.txt,"As a result, banks, in aggregate, are currently using reserve balances to meet a significant portion of their LCR requirements.",0.613271,0.618850
20180504.txt,"In addition, because these changes happened together, it is reasonable to conclude that the current environment is likely not very informative about banks' underlying demand for reserve balances.",0.728083,0.465309

20180504.txt,"According to this line of thought, because central bank reserve balances and Treasury securities are treated identically by the LCR, banks should be largely indifferent to holding either asset to meet the regulation.",0.728702,0.263372
20180504.txt,"In that case, the reduction in reserves and corresponding increase in Treasury holdings might occur with relatively little adjustment in their relative rates of return.",0.627768,0.528001

20180504.txt,"Despite holding roughly similarly amounts of HQLA, the two banks exhibit very different HQLA compositions, with the bank depicted in the top panel consistently holding a much larger share of HQLA in the form of reserve balances than the bank shown in the bottom panel.",0.648720,0.452561

20180531.txt,One reason the 10-year Treasury yield may be unusually low is that market expectations of interest rates in the longer run may be unusually low.,0.552391,0.323209
20180531.txt,A second reason may be that the term premium--the extra compensation an investor would demand for investing in a 10-year bond rather than rolling over a shorter-dated instrument repeatedly over a 10-year period--has fallen to levels that are very low by historical standards.,0.240818,0.101802

20180531.txt,"11

A second reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changing correlation between stock and bond returns, likely caused by changes in expected inflation outcomes.",0.577104,0.513948

20180531.txt,This changed correlation between stock and bond returns in turn may be related to better anchored inflation expectations following a long period of low and stable inflation.,0.515798,0.655922

20181109.txt,"As you know, one of the most visible aspects of our stress testing program is that the firms and the public receive an independent view of the capital adequacy of the largest banks.",0.645339,0.435559
20181109.txt,The results are based on our own models and provide a consistent yardstick to measure resiliency across the banking system.,0.626657,0.566873
20181109.txt,But the stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve is only one part of our stress testing regime.,0.649651,0.157142
20181109.txt,"Just as important, we require each firm to run its own stress test, using its own models and a stressful scenario that reflects the firm's assessment of its idiosyncratic risks and key vulnerabilities.",0.718294,0.318050
20181109.txt,"Underpinning a firm's stress test is the firm's ability to identify and measure risks under normal and stressful conditions and the strength of the firm's internal processes, and we use the supervisory process to ensure that the firms' stress testing practices employ sound methodologies.",0.641619,0.537644
20181109.txt,"The combination of the Federal Reserve's common yardstick, the firm's own stress tests, and supervisory oversight over the firms' practices has resulted in a meaningful increase in the post-stress resiliency of large financial institutions.",0.307328,0.722848
20181109.txt,All of these core components will remain in place.,0.641667,0.387668
20181109.txt,"Further, the changes I'll speak about today are not intended to alter materially the overall level of capital in the system or the stringency of the regime.",0.712058,0.291721
20181109.txt,"A healthy U.S. economy relies on a strong, well-capitalized banking system that can weather stressful events and continue lending to households and businesses.",0.453822,0.659912
20181109.txt,"The U.S. banking organizations subject to the 2018 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)--the Fed's evaluation of capital adequacy for large holding companies--have increased the dollar amount of their common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital from around $500 billion in 2009 to more than $1.2 trillion as of the second quarter of this year, and have more than doubled CET1 risk-based capital ratios from approximately 5 percent to over 12 percent over the same period.",0.145727,0.652089
20181109.txt,"While the regime has been successful overall, I believe it is prudent to review all our practices to ensure that they are as efficient and transparent as possible and that they remain appropriate in light of changes in the industry that have been achieved.",0.571941,0.705767
20181109.txt,"For instance, as firms become more resilient, they may no longer need to build capital to support their current level of risk taking, but rather move into the mode of retaining the capital they have already built.",0.646430,0.499207
20181109.txt,"Firms have also significantly improved their risk management, providing room to adjust our approach to assessing capital planning practices.",0.315673,0.713098
20181109.txt,"Finally, as we make changes to our regime, the issue of volatility in the stress test results becomes more pronounced.",0.683772,0.500159
20181109.txt,"As I'll discuss, we are considering how to balance the need to preserve the dynamism in stress testing with the need to ensure that firms have sufficient notice regarding the capital requirements to which they are held.",0.753354,0.498490
20181109.txt,Stress Capital Buffer Many of you are familiar with the Federal Reserve's proposal to integrate the stress test with the regulatory capital rule--known as the stress capital buffer (SCB).,0.621004,0.226068
20181109.txt,1 I believe the SCB proposal represents an important milestone as we enter the next chapter of our stress testing regime.,0.473918,0.575490
20181109.txt,"For those who are not familiar with the SCB, let me provide a little background about how our capital rule currently works, and how it would be modified by the SCB.",0.636599,0.123818
20181109.txt,"As devoted readers of our capital rules may know, our regulatory capital rule includes both minimum capital requirements and a buffer that sits on top of those minimum requirements.",0.659665,0.209026
20181109.txt,"The buffer serves as an early warning to a firm and to supervisors, and it requires the firm to reduce its capital distributions as the firm approaches the minimum requirements.",0.572195,0.308896
20181109.txt,"Under the current capital rule, all firms are subject to a fixed buffer requirement of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets--the largest firms are also subject to a global systemically important bank surcharge and potential countercyclical capital buffer.",0.680688,0.339685
20181109.txt,"For large firms, the SCB would replace the fixed 2.5 percent risk-based buffer with a firm-specific buffer the size of which would be based on the firm's stress test results.",0.656953,0.332204
20181109.txt,"In this way, we are integrating the automatic restrictions on capital distributions in the current capital rule with the output of the most dynamic tool we have for assessing risk--the stress test--to create a more robust and dynamic regulatory capital regime.",0.597160,0.474288
20181109.txt,"The SCB would also result in a more transparent and simplified system of regulatory capital requirements, because a firm will be held to a single, integrated capital regime.",0.652424,0.425622
20181109.txt,"When we made our SCB proposal last April, we had aimed to make the SCB final for the 2019 stress test cycle.",0.697715,0.369451
20181109.txt,"However, the comments we received have been extensive and thoughtful, and have raised issues that require a carefully considered response.",0.678864,0.549271
20181109.txt,"While I don't believe these issues will prevent us from ultimately implementing the SCB, they have flagged certain elements of the regime that could benefit from further refinement.",0.648441,0.654454
20181109.txt,"Accordingly, I expect we will adopt a final rule in the near future that will settle the basic framework of the SCB, but re-propose certain elements.",0.733462,0.394600
20181109.txt,"To enable this process to run its course, I expect that the first SCB would not go into effect before 2020.",0.737984,0.379266
20181109.txt,"For 2019, I expect CCAR will remain in place for firms with over $250 billion in assets or that are otherwise complex; however, we will consider whether we can move forward with any aspects of the SCB proposal for CCAR 2019, such as assumptions related to balance sheet growth.",0.687127,0.549445
20181109.txt,I will also ask the Board to exempt firms with less than $250 billion in assets from the CCAR quantitative assessment and supervisory stress testing in 2019 in light of the every-other-year cycle contemplated in the tailoring proposal that the Board approved two weeks ago.,0.690700,0.401012
20181109.txt,"2

Returning to the SCB proposal, I would like to give you a sense of the comments we received and our approach to addressing those concerns.",0.646734,0.367433
20181109.txt,The issue foremost on my mind is the volatility of the stress test results.,0.551080,0.311305
20181109.txt,"One concern frequently expressed is that the results of the supervisory stress test can lead to capital requirements that change significantly from year to year, which limits a firm's ability to manage its capital effectively.",0.389290,0.195051
20181109.txt,"Some amount of volatility is necessary to preserve the dynamism of the stress test--by nature, the stress test will differ year-over-year based on macroeconomic conditions and contemporary understanding of salient risks in the economy.",0.793327,0.447282
20181109.txt,"In addition, the stress test results are sensitive to changes in a firm's balance sheet, which means that a firm's capital requirements will evolve as the firm's activities and exposure evolve.",0.751782,0.438923
20181109.txt,"However, I do think there is an important balance to be struck between preserving this dynamism and ensuring that firms have sufficient notice regarding the capital requirements to which they are held.",0.664587,0.646575
20181109.txt,"In the first years after the financial crisis, as the banking system was dramatically ramping up the total amount of capital in the system, this volatility was less of a management problem: until we reached reasonably full capitalization, each year every bank needed to increase its capital.",0.687560,0.626122
20181109.txt,"If one year that increment was a little higher or a little lower than the previous year, that was simply a modest difference of velocity, not direction.",0.662913,0.322434
20181109.txt,"At the current juncture, however, both our system as a whole and each of the largest banks in that system are fully meeting their capital requirements.",0.606415,0.646861
20181109.txt,"In these circumstances, having a highly variable capital requirement presents a significant management challenge.",0.578803,0.413810
20181109.txt,"We are considering ways of preserving the dynamism of stress testing while reducing its volatility, and plan to seek comment on a proposal in this area in the not-too-distant future.",0.643715,0.539652
20181109.txt,"In addition, we are also exploring ways of improving our approach to measuring risks in the trading book.",0.519913,0.605913
20181109.txt,"Firms' trading books are dynamic and complex, as firms hold both long and short positions.",0.587964,0.141727
20181109.txt,"Many have noted that a single market shock does not adequately capture risks in firms' trading book, and we agree with those comments.",0.693379,0.389752
20181109.txt,We are exploring ways to incorporate multiple market shocks in our stress test without adding volatility to the results and without increasing the compliance burden.,0.547211,0.687882
20181109.txt,We are also considering adjusting another element of the SCB proposal in order to provide more notice to firms.,0.712003,0.466214
20181109.txt,"Currently, and under the SCB proposal, a firm must decide whether to increase or decrease its planned dividends and share repurchases for the upcoming year without knowledge of a key constraint: the results of the stress test.",0.697515,0.424470
20181109.txt,"In other words, we require a firm to give us a formal plan for dividends and stock repurchases without knowing what its effective capital requirement is.",0.683026,0.237451
20181109.txt,"If it guesses wrong, it could be publicly shamed for failing the stress test (if its dividends are too high relative to capital), or penalized in the markets for inadequate distribution of income (if its dividends are too low relative to capital).",0.122749,0.068243
20181109.txt,"Now, while this might at first blush appear to be pointless and obdurate cruelty, the reasoning behind the practice was initially perfectly sensible: it reflected the view that firms should think rigorously about their capital uses and needs in developing their capital distribution plans, rather than rely primarily on the results of the supervisory stress test to guide those plans.",0.698287,0.388425
20181109.txt,"Now that we all have several years' experience with this system, however, firms have told us that they would be able to engage in more thoughtful capital planning if they had knowledge of that year's stress test results before finalizing their distribution plans for the upcoming year.",0.556763,0.614395
20181109.txt,"I am sympathetic to their concerns, and will ask the Board to adjust the operation of the rule so that firms know their SCB before they decide on their planned distributions for the coming year.",0.774480,0.434318
20181109.txt,This adjustment in sequence will also help firms manage volatility in the SCB.,0.635397,0.669827
20181109.txt,"We expect firms to continue to maintain robust stress testing practices and use those results to inform their capital distribution plans, and we will continue to use the supervisory process to reinforce this expectation.",0.416125,0.712661
20181109.txt,"The comments also highlighted an issue with how the capital buffers operate today, which is amplified by the inherent volatility of the SCB.",0.475652,0.349082
20181109.txt,"As I noted earlier, a firm operating in its capital buffer is required to reduce its capital distributions so that it can build capital over time.",0.694068,0.472365
20181109.txt,"By design, the buffer was intended to apply increasingly stringent limitations as the firm's capital ratios decline.",0.745283,0.562654
20181109.txt,"But, in our current world in which a healthy and profitable banking system is seeking to maintain its capital levels rather than continue to increase them, a bank will appropriately and safely tend to distribute much or all of its income in any given year.",0.691248,0.674160
20181109.txt,"In that case, the operation of the buffer would not result in a proportional restriction of income as the firm's capital eases, but could be a sudden cessation of all dividends if the firm dips into the buffer by even a small amount, even if the changes in its capital levels are quite minor.",0.663961,0.351299
20181109.txt,We are considering adjustments that would make the rules more consistent with the graduated intent.,0.713493,0.535792
20181109.txt,We plan to work with the other banking agencies to consider how best to effect this change.,0.672733,0.519723
20181109.txt,There are two additional elements of the SCB proposal that I believe would benefit from modification.,0.593601,0.376367
20181109.txt,"First, the SCB proposal would have included four quarters of dividends in a firm's SCB, in recognition of the fact that firms experience market pressure to hold dividends constant, even under stress.",0.712736,0.446547
20181109.txt,"In my view, there may be ways of encouraging greater reliance on less sticky repurchases while providing more flexibility in the regime, and we are exploring alternatives.",0.573385,0.670433
20181109.txt,"Last, the SCB proposal would have included a post-stress leverage requirement.",0.677583,0.298618
20181109.txt,"As the Federal Reserve has long maintained, leverage requirements are intended to serve as a backstop to the risk-based capital requirements.",0.739192,0.482220
20181109.txt,"By definition, they are not intended to be risk-sensitive.",0.648937,0.179779
20181109.txt,"Thus, I am concerned that explicitly assigning a leverage buffer requirement to a firm on the basis of risk-sensitive post-stress estimates runs afoul of the intellectual underpinnings of the leverage ratio, and I would advocate removing this element of the stress capital buffer regime.",0.657790,0.272110
20181109.txt,"Of course, leverage ratios, including the enhanced supplementary leverage requirements, would remain a critical part of our regulatory capital regime, and we will maintain the supervisory expectation that firms have sufficient capital to meet all minimum regulatory requirements.",0.672961,0.578930
20181109.txt,"Together, the adjustments we are contemplating to the SCB offer promise in improving the efficiency, coherence, and transparency of the regulatory capital regime while maintaining the overall level of capital in the system and the core principles of the regime that have proven successful.",0.528546,0.646683
20181109.txt,"That being said, we welcome a continued dialogue with the public as we implement these changes, and through that implementation, we will ensure that we maintain the incentives for effective stress testing practices that exist today.",0.526647,0.665830
20181109.txt,"Transparency Transparency of the stress test and its inputs and outputs is key to the credibility of the stress test, and there are several initiatives underway to provide additional transparency regarding the supervisory stress test models and scenario design process.",0.630688,0.455671
20181109.txt,"We believe that the adjustments under development strike the right balance of advancing transparency, while maintaining incentives for firms to think critically about their own risks.",0.645516,0.614217
20181109.txt,I expect that soon you will see the Federal Reserve issue a policy statement describing governing principles around the supervisory stress testing process.,0.701002,0.343076
20181109.txt,"As a part of that statement, I would expect a commitment to disclose additional detail about supervisory stress test models and results and to publish portfolios of hypothetical loans and associated loss rates.",0.654218,0.298316
20181109.txt,"I expect that we will begin providing some of this additional detail starting in early 2019, and that these changes will allow firms to benchmark the results of their own models against those of the supervisory models.",0.666969,0.431643
20181109.txt,"However, our commitment to transparency does not end there.",0.689423,0.484062
20181109.txt,"We are currently considering options to provide additional transparency regarding scenarios and scenario design and I expect that the Board will seek comment on the advisability of, and possible approaches to, gathering the public's input on scenarios and salient risks facing the banking system each year.",0.686152,0.439337
20181109.txt,"Such a proposal may also provide additional details about the scenario design features that underpins each year's scenarios, and a range of other enhancements.",0.593428,0.251551
20181109.txt,"Additional transparency regarding the stress test scenarios serves multiple purposes: it both provides additional due process to affected participants, and provides additional sources of insight--including from academics and thought leaders like many of you in this room--that could be used to inform a given year's scenario.",0.606384,0.290993
20181109.txt,Increased transparency could also enable us to be more nimble in our scenario design to the extent we uncover through external input new salient risks that we have not previously considered.,0.532726,0.696183
20181109.txt,"As we develop proposals, a key consideration is to ensure that we maintain incentives for firms to conduct their own stress tests rigorously and thoughtfully.",0.686422,0.567739
20181109.txt,Firms have indicated that additional disclosure about models would not affect their own stress tests.,0.743219,0.437659
20181109.txt,"We expect them to make good on that representation, as the Federal Reserve's stress test is not, and cannot be, a full picture of a firm's resiliency in light of its idiosyncratic risks.",0.695840,0.478386
20181109.txt,"For example, there is some risk that firms will use knowledge from additional transparency about the stress test to engage in transactions that are solely designed to reduce losses in the test, but that do not truly reduce risk in their portfolios.",0.662330,0.430310
20181109.txt,"As supervisors, however, this is something that we can guard against through the regular examination process.",0.717055,0.423528
20181109.txt,"We will closely monitor changes in firms' portfolios and take appropriate actions to ensure firms are holding sufficient capital, and have sufficient controls and governance, in light of the risk characteristics of their activities.",0.699683,0.565216
20181109.txt,"Qualitative Objection Before I close, I would like to say a few words about the role of the qualitative objection in our new chapter of stress testing.",0.597769,0.172656
20181109.txt,"As originally conceived, CCAR had both a quantitative component--based on the supervisory stress test--and a qualitative component--based on the Federal Reserve's assessment of a firm's stress testing practices.",0.645253,0.291591
20181109.txt,"In 2017, the Federal Reserve eliminated the qualitative objection as part of CCAR for large and noncomplex firms, in part because of improvements in risk management at these firms.",0.587347,0.455967
20181109.txt,"3 By incorporating supervisory stress testing into the regulatory capital regime and introducing an automatic penalty if a firm falls below its SCB-derived capital requirement, the SCB proposal will eliminate the quantitative objection from CCAR.",0.647434,0.535053
20181109.txt,The natural next question is: has the CCAR qualitative objection for the largest firms also run its course?,0.642489,0.299043
20181109.txt,"In my view, the time has come to normalize the CCAR qualitative assessment by removing the public objection tool, and continuing to evaluate firms' stress testing practices through normal supervision.",0.707778,0.458940
20181109.txt,"In such an environment, firms would remain subject to the same supervisory expectations, and examiners would continue to conduct rigorous horizontal and firm-specific assessments of a firm's capital positions and capital planning, tailored to the risk profile of the firm.",0.734174,0.429267
20181109.txt,"While much of the examination work would center on a firm's capital plan submissions, examination work would continue on a year-round basis, taking into account the firm's management of other financial risks.",0.679016,0.324665
20181109.txt,The evaluation of the firm's capital position and capital planning would culminate in a rating of the firm's capital position and planning.,0.619408,0.390100
20181109.txt,"Firms with deficient practices would receive supervisory findings through the examination process, and would be at risk of a ratings downgrade or enforcement action if those deficiencies were sufficiently material.",0.314559,0.123740
20181109.txt,"Conclusion As we begin the next chapter in stress testing, my objective is to ensure the continued credibility of the program by increasing its transparency, simplicity, and stability while maintaining the strength of the supervisory and internal stress testing elements that are central to the program today.",0.619359,0.533561
20181109.txt,These adjustments will be coupled with our continued commitment to strong supervision and our expectation that financial institutions ensure they are managing their risks and holding sufficient capital to continue operations through times of stress.,0.586107,0.731163

20181116.txt,"Today, I want to highlight three elements in particular.",0.647620,0.313910

20190222.txt,The statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.,0.668249,0.678750

20190222.txt,13 Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.,0.722063,0.714017

Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal K. Quarles

At the 2019 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New York

When I was asked to participate on this panel in the middle of last year, the prevailing metaphor regarding Federal Reserve balance sheet policy was ""as boring as watching paint dry.""",0.516928,0.041036
20190222.txt,"Well, times have changed, and I commend the conference organizers for their foresight.",0.499172,0.593132
20190222.txt,Today I would like to discuss some of the recent decisions that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made regarding the balance sheet and lay out a rough framework for some further issues that are on the horizon.,0.659795,0.334560
20190222.txt,"1

In January, after much discussion, including in previous meetings, the FOMC announced its intent to continue operating in a framework of ample reserves.",0.546056,0.649313
20190222.txt,"2 In this regime, active management of the reserve supply is not needed.",0.721273,0.301927
20190222.txt,"The Federal Reserve controls the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates primarily through the use of administered rates, including the rate paid on reserve balances and the offered rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements.",0.663025,0.141224
20190222.txt,"This regime is sometimes referred to as a floor system, because the administered rates place a floor under the rate at which banks and others will lend in the federal funds market.",0.684298,0.238850
20190222.txt,"In adopting this framework, the Committee stated its intention to continue operating as it has for the past decade.",0.615188,0.596382
20190222.txt,The announcement was an important step in our normalization process.,0.531470,0.530808
20190222.txt,And we are now set up to make further decisions on the eventual size and composition of our balance sheet.,0.686372,0.362897
20190222.txt,"Before providing more context on those decisions, let me first provide a little more detail around our decision to remain in the current framework of ample reserves.",0.684197,0.347052
20190222.txt,The most important factor in the decision was that the current system has worked very well.,0.492786,0.673082
20190222.txt,It has supported the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.,0.536186,0.719377
20190222.txt,"And it has shown itself to be flexible and well suited to maintaining interest rate control through various changes in money markets, bank regulation, and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.",0.589759,0.706275
20190222.txt,"Since the FOMC began lifting interest rates in December 2015, money market rates have generally moved closely with the federal funds rate, which in turn has followed changes in administered rates.",0.752180,0.541030
20190222.txt,"Now that the decision on the operating framework has been made, a natural next step is to contemplate the appropriate size of the Fed's balance sheet and reserves and the process for getting there.",0.692258,0.446716
20190222.txt,"In line with the requirements of operating with ample reserves--and boosted by the growth in nonreserve liabilities--the Fed will maintain a larger balance sheet and reserve supply relative to the pre-crisis period, with the goal of remaining on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.",0.598206,0.794512
20190222.txt,"I would note that reserves have already declined appreciably from their peak, falling by $1.2 trillion to a current level of around $1.6 trillion.",0.103062,0.031343
20190222.txt,"At the same time, we have seen a substantial increase in our nonreserve liabilities, such as currency in circulation and the Treasury General Account balance.",0.331338,0.733539
20190222.txt,"In our statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, we outlined an intention to hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.",0.721840,0.544680
20190222.txt,"3 As the balance sheet continues to shrink, we are now in the process of determining that necessary size.",0.671573,0.365375
20190222.txt,"Ultimately, the size of the balance sheet will be determined by a number of factors, including demand for nonreserve liabilities, such as currency (which has been rising), and, importantly, the quantity of reserves necessary to remain reliably on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.",0.784069,0.561867
20190222.txt,Survey results suggest that banks have greatly increased their demand for reserves in the post-crisis period.,0.162205,0.723184
20190222.txt,"Responses to the September 2018 Senior Financial Officer Survey report that banks would be comfortable with a level of reserves in the system in the neighborhood of $800 billion, taking into consideration the level of interest rates at the time.",0.634309,0.707555
20190222.txt,"4 In part, this increased demand reflects a response to regulatory changes introduced after the crisis.",0.446274,0.707991
20190222.txt,"These changes include, importantly, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which has improved banks' liquidity resilience by requiring firms to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover potential outflows during times of stress.",0.302549,0.742661
20190222.txt,"Reserves, along with Treasury securities, are favored under the LCR, and, consequently, firms currently meet a sizable fraction of their LCR requirements by holding reserves.",0.655704,0.416261
20190222.txt,"Notwithstanding survey results, the level of reserve demand remains quite uncertain.",0.678237,0.487667
20190222.txt,"It is possible that, over time, the preferences of banks will shift, or that demand will prove more price elastic than banks are currently expecting.",0.655960,0.603958
20190222.txt,"As I have discussed previously, bank holdings of reserves to meet LCR requirements could shift toward Treasury securities, as aggregate reserves decline, without much upward pressure on the federal funds rate.",0.647111,0.397494
20190222.txt,"5 That said, even if uncertain, it is probably safe to say that reserve demand is much higher than before the crisis.",0.448190,0.745208
20190222.txt,"As we work to calibrate ample reserves, there are some tradeoffs that are worth noting.",0.641484,0.545945
20190222.txt,"For example, we could operate with a level of reserve balances at the lower end of what might be considered ample.",0.762623,0.507876
20190222.txt,"In that case, there would likely be occasions when unexpected declines in the supply of reserves or increases in the demand for reserves would require an open market operation to offset temporary upward pressures on the federal funds rate.",0.576452,0.559825
20190222.txt,"Alternatively, we could operate with an average supply of reserves large enough to keep the federal funds rate determined along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve even with an unexpected shift in the supply of or demand for reserves.",0.749495,0.638485
20190222.txt,This approach would be operationally convenient but would also leave the size of the balance sheet and reserves larger than necessary most of the time.,0.715192,0.587896
20190222.txt,"In my view, it might be appropriate for us to operate somewhere in between these two extremes, with a sizable quantity of reserves large enough to buffer against most shocks to reserve supply.",0.662951,0.729851
20190222.txt,"On those few days when that buffer is likely to be exhausted, we could conduct open market operations to temporarily boost the supply of reserves.",0.480592,0.737205
20190222.txt,"With so much uncertainty over the level and slope of the reserve demand curve, a degree of caution is warranted.",0.758852,0.544996
20190222.txt,"As outlined in the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, the Committee has discussed ending the reduction in the Fed's aggregate asset holdings sometime in the latter half of this year, with still-ample reserves in the system.",0.525304,0.619222
20190222.txt,"6 At that point, one option discussed, without any decision being made at this point, is to hold the level of total assets roughly fixed for a time.",0.774663,0.359497
20190222.txt,"Even as the total size of the balance sheet remains fixed, the composition of the liabilities would gradually change, in part as demand for currency grows in line with the economy.",0.711722,0.496400
20190222.txt,"Over time, the gradual increase in nonreserve liabilities would displace reserves as the overall balance sheet remains fixed.",0.608494,0.504981
20190222.txt,"This plan would substantially reduce the pace of the decline in reserves, allowing us to gradually approach our assessment of the appropriate amount of reserves for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.",0.566811,0.787434
20190222.txt,"Of course, in the longer run, once we reach our preferred level of reserves, the balance sheet would have to resume growth to match a continued increase in demand for nonreserve liabilities.",0.394404,0.793751
20190222.txt,I would like to wrap up with a brief discussion of some of the other decision points we will encounter as we continue the process of normalizing our balance sheet.,0.677729,0.356162
20190222.txt,"In particular, what does the Committee judge to be normal in regard to the type and duration of assets that we will hold?",0.640869,0.122379
20190222.txt,"On composition, in line with our previously announced normalization principles, I favor a return to a balance sheet with all Treasury securities, allowing our mortgage-backed securities (MBS) holdings to run to zero.",0.741406,0.565374
20190222.txt,"In those principles, we also state that while we do not expect sales of MBS as part of the normalization process, later we would be open to limited sales to reduce or eliminate residual holdings of MBS.",0.698440,0.460881
20190222.txt,"In regard to duration, moving to shorten the duration of our holdings could increase the Fed's ability to affect long-term interest rates if the need arose.",0.682427,0.593119
20190222.txt,"However, it might be preferable to have the composition of our Treasury holdings roughly match the maturity composition of outstanding Treasury securities, minimizing any market distortions that could arise from our holdings.",0.746522,0.501252
20190222.txt,"Over the course of our upcoming meetings, I look forward to what promises to be an interesting discussion on these issues with my colleagues.",0.577196,0.460355
20190222.txt,"Finally, in assessing our balance sheet policy, it is important to point out that the Fed remains entirely focused on meeting its statutory dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.",0.794247,0.610535
20190222.txt,The normalization of the balance sheet is not a competing goal.,0.672241,0.444923
20190222.txt,"If ever it appears that our plans for the balance sheet are running counter to the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, we would quickly reassess our approach to the balance sheet.",0.719494,0.492501

20190329.txt,The notable levels of vulnerability in asset valuation pressures and business borrowing must be considered alongside modest vulnerabilities associated with household borrowing and the historically low levels of financial-sector leverage and funding risk.,0.686924,0.517362

20190329.txt,I see three important explanations for differences in the CCyB across countries.,0.635663,0.475504
20190329.txt,Perhaps the most important and direct reason for different CCyB levels among different countries is that they face different vulnerabilities.,0.667739,0.392195
20190329.txt,"According to national authorities' announcements, the decisions to activate the buffers were generally motivated by credit growth, household debt, and housing prices; in this regard, it is notable that mortgage credit or house prices have expanded rapidly in several countries deploying the CCyB, including Hong Kong and the Nordic countries that have set their CCyB at 2.5 percent.",0.557583,0.668886
20190329.txt,"For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's decision to increase the CCyB level to 2.5 percent in January 2018 was importantly linked to housing developments.",0.606981,0.656372
20190329.txt,Another explanation for the differences in observed CCyB levels across countries is the range of available macroprudential tools to stem the buildup in financial vulnerabilities in different countries and the degree to which such tools have been the preferred means for addressing identified vulnerabilities.,0.679509,0.550454
20190329.txt,"8 For example, housing market booms, as noted above for Hong Kong, have been a concern in several countries in recent years.",0.474286,0.397227
20190329.txt,"9 Accordingly, some national authorities have used macroprudential tools focused on housing, such as caps on loan-to-value ratios, to try to increase the resilience of borrowers and to indirectly strengthen the resilience of the banks and the financial system should their housing booms turn to busts.",0.484438,0.771601

20190329.txt,"10 The availability of such alternative tools for limiting systemic risk may be among the factors influencing the decision to adjust, or not adjust, the CCyB in a number of countries.",0.768336,0.486764
20190329.txt,"In this regard, it is notable that the set of macroprudential tools in the United States is limited relative to that in many other countries.",0.713767,0.341476
20190329.txt,"11

Finally, another difference, one that is particular to the United Kingdom, is the framework adopted by the U.K. Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to integrate the CCyB with its structural capital requirements.",0.645321,0.450131
20190329.txt,"Specifically, under the FPC's framework, the CCyB would equal 1 percent in standard risk conditions--but to avoid having this be a significant increase to already very high levels of capital, the FPC undertook a one-time adjustment to its other capital buffers in order to offset part of this increase.",0.506865,0.742701
20190329.txt,The effect of the policy is that the buffer can be varied--both up and down--in line with the changing risks that the banking system faces over time.,0.772777,0.501176
20190329.txt,"This approach is an interesting deviation from the idea in the original Basel discussions and the framework adopted in many other jurisdictions, in which structural capital requirements are set at levels aimed to deliver the desired level of resilience, with the CCyB raised to positive values only at times when vulnerabilities are above normal.",0.742836,0.543701
20190329.txt,"In practice, the U.K. framework appears to have provided the FPC with additional flexibility, as it has adjusted the CCyB with evolving financial risks associated with, for example, Brexit.",0.438809,0.773101
20190329.txt,"As I examine this experience, systems similar to the United Kingdom's, where the CCyB is positive during normal times, may allow policymakers to react more quickly to economic, financial, or even geopolitical shocks that occur amid otherwise normal conditions, without relying on the slow-moving credit aggregates contemplated in the original Basel proposal.",0.704161,0.517154

20190329.txt,"The United Kingdom's approach to setting the CCyB also relies on having a high overall level of capital during normal times, but, by ""swapping"" some portion of static capital for CCyB in reaching that high capital level during normal times, and thus making some of that capital part of a releasable buffer, U.K. policymakers have built in more flexibility to move buffers down in times of stress.",0.685383,0.611901

Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida

At the ""Fed Listens: Distributional Consequences of the Cycle and Monetary Policy"" Conference hosted by the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minnesota

I am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event on the distributional consequences of the business cycle and monetary policy.",0.561700,0.295119
20190409.txt,The Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is a natural venue for discussing this topic in the context of the broad review of our monetary policy framework that we are undertaking this year.,0.639344,0.474289
20190409.txt,"1 In our review, we are examining the policy strategy, tools, and communication practices that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) uses to pursue the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.",0.682137,0.371285
20190409.txt,I will speak this evening about the motivation for and scope of our review.,0.650135,0.248641
20190409.txt,"We are bringing open minds to it and are seeking perspectives from a broad range of interested individuals and groups, such as the panel of researchers we heard from this afternoon and the community leaders we will hear from tomorrow.",0.562764,0.360274
20190409.txt,"To us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to engage broadly with the public in this review as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.",0.628911,0.472020
20190409.txt,"2

Motivation for the Review The Federal Reserve has been charged by the Congress with a dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability, and this review will take this mandate as given.",0.673789,0.309891
20190409.txt,"Moreover, the review will take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) is the operational goal most consistent with our price stability mandate.",0.788424,0.712239
20190409.txt,"While we believe that our existing framework for conducting monetary policy has served the public well, the purpose of this review is to evaluate and assess ways in which our existing framework might be improved so that we can best achieve our dual mandate objectives on a sustained basis.",0.502918,0.673311
20190409.txt,"That said, based on the experience of other central banks that have undertaken similar reviews, our review is more likely to produce evolution, not a revolution, in the way that we conduct monetary policy.",0.670841,0.449771
20190409.txt,"With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.",0.727256,0.533857
20190409.txt,"The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.",0.444253,0.422785
20190409.txt,We want to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in coming years.,0.498274,0.706788
20190409.txt,"In addition, the Federal Reserve used new policy tools and enhanced its communication practices in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession, and the review will evaluate these changes.",0.574008,0.606843
20190409.txt,"Furthermore, the U.S. and foreign economies have evolved significantly since the experience that informed much of the pre-crisis approach.",0.536489,0.654285
20190409.txt,"Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United States and abroad.",0.332608,0.521063
20190409.txt,"3 Moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to persist for years.",0.426980,0.524810
20190409.txt,"The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth.",0.390337,0.341491
20190409.txt,"These factors' contributions are highly uncertain, but, irrespective of their precise role, the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important.",0.689259,0.537818
20190409.txt,"All else being equal, a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank's policy rate will reach its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.",0.390340,0.534030
20190409.txt,"That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support household spending, business investment, and employment, and keep inflation from falling too low.",0.669179,0.720161
20190409.txt,"4

Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack.",0.569171,0.650613
20190409.txt,"That is, the short-run Phillips curve appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.",0.482991,0.558378
20190409.txt,"5 A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.",0.615732,0.416739
20190409.txt,It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsââas was the case during and after the Great Recession--because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.,0.645659,0.742470
20190409.txt,"6 However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.",0.343198,0.589842
20190409.txt,"Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.",0.748023,0.747415
20190409.txt,"7

Finally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to the full employment leg of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.",0.559767,0.654750
20190409.txt,"The unemployment rate, which stood at 3.8 percent in March, has been interpreted by many observers as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.",0.214738,0.199603
20190409.txt,"However, the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be estimated.",0.702464,0.230653
20190409.txt,The range of plausible estimates likely extends at least as low as the current level of the unemployment rate.,0.692365,0.340025
20190409.txt,"For example, in the February Blue Chip economic outlook survey, the average estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for the bottom 10 respondents was 3.9 percent, as compared with 4.7 percent for the highest 10 respondents.",0.296994,0.267425
20190409.txt,"8

The decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by an increase in labor force participation, with especially pronounced gains for individuals in their prime working years.",0.227718,0.688861
20190409.txt,9 These increases in participation have provided employers with a significant source of additional labor input and may be one factor restraining inflationary pressures.,0.334603,0.746684
20190409.txt,"As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain.",0.623592,0.619085
20190409.txt,The strong job gains of recent years also has delivered benefits to groups that have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market.,0.233464,0.714429
20190409.txt,"For example, African Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.",0.167729,0.313116
20190409.txt,"10 However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.",0.305007,0.766811
20190409.txt,"11 Likewise, although unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they are for their more-educated counterparts, such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.",0.357344,0.678419
20190409.txt,12 And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.,0.298925,0.636173
20190409.txt,"13

Scope of the Review Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.",0.698519,0.296435
20190409.txt,"14 First adopted in January 2012, the statement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including earlier this year with unanimous support from all 17 FOMC participants.",0.591195,0.535025
20190409.txt,The statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.,0.668249,0.678750
20190409.txt,"In doing so, the FOMC recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.",0.641564,0.330407
20190409.txt,"According to the Federal Reserve Act, the employment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation objective.",0.716709,0.455717
20190409.txt,"As a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known in the research literature as ""flexible inflation targeting.""",0.711839,0.387874
20190409.txt,"15 However, the Fed's mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than those of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the other.",0.742368,0.363676
20190409.txt,We believe this transparency about the balanced approach the FOMC takes has served us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary policies that entailed some risk of inflation.,0.630340,0.722231
20190409.txt,"The review of our current framework will be wide ranging, and we will not prejudge where it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions.",0.655517,0.274329
20190409.txt,"Three Questions The first question is, ""Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?""",0.705486,0.432082
20190409.txt,"Under our current approach as well as that of many central banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that many advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as ""bygones.""",0.489296,0.277337
20190409.txt,This means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls with future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target).,0.740952,0.402459
20190409.txt,"Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the effective lower bound on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely.",0.651634,0.661664
20190409.txt,Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become anchored below the stated inflation goal.,0.354766,0.191331
20190409.txt,"16

In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation deviations from target.",0.695949,0.538021
20190409.txt,"Such strategies include targeting average inflation over a multiyear period and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.",0.750988,0.483982
20190409.txt,17 These strategies could be implemented either permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances.,0.653364,0.326704
20190409.txt,"For example, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the ELB, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the ELB period has, on average, run at the target rate.",0.809551,0.450891
20190409.txt,18 Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.,0.723691,0.717736
20190409.txt,"19 In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and thereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual-mandate goals.",0.516855,0.668371
20190409.txt,"20

The benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes--for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent.",0.607319,0.618405
20190409.txt,"As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not warrant doing so.",0.738423,0.320582
20190409.txt,"Because of this time inconsistency, the public would have to see a makeup strategy as a credible commitment for it to be successful.",0.728640,0.565765
20190409.txt,"That important real-world consideration is often neglected in the academic literature, in which central bank ""commitment devices"" are simply assumed to exist and be instantly credible on decree.",0.634334,0.141662
20190409.txt,"Thus, one of the most challenging questions is whether central banks could, in practice, attain the benefits of makeup strategies that are possible in models.",0.630050,0.409786
20190409.txt,"The next question the review will consider is, ""Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?",0.681420,0.528598

20190409.txt,The FOMC's primary means of changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal funds rate.,0.809604,0.414767
20190409.txt,"In the fall of 2008, the FOMC cut that target to just above zero in response to financial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions.",0.391832,0.357531
20190409.txt,"Because the U.S. economy required additional policy accommodation after the ELB was reached, the FOMC deployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis: balance sheet policies and forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate.",0.716093,0.476110
20190409.txt,"21

The FOMC altered the size and composition of the Fed's balance sheet through a sequence of three large-scale securities purchase programs, via a maturity extension program, and by adjusting the reinvestment of principal payments on maturing securities.",0.665315,0.351860
20190409.txt,"With regard to forward guidance, the FOMC initially made ""calendar based"" statements, and, later on, it issued ""outcome based"" guidance.",0.679097,0.218437

But there are many questions about how community banks are adjusting to the changing environment.",0.674280,0.412732
20190411.txt,"For instance, about 40 percent of community banks say that they do not currently offer online loan applications and have no immediate plans to do so.",0.569600,0.069036
20190411.txt,19 That 40 percent may represent bankers who have not gone through the process of thinking about the way innovation impacts their business.,0.634969,0.224522
20190411.txt,But it could just as easily include bankers who have looked at the issue carefully and concluded that online loan applications do not fit within their business model.,0.585054,0.177759
20190411.txt,"Most importantly, though, it may indicate that some community banks may feel that they are simply not able to leverage new technology.",0.464587,0.283276
20190411.txt,Most small banks are dependent on partnerships with third parties to make use of new technologies.,0.606775,0.272904
20190411.txt,20 I am concerned that some banks are not innovating because they feel they lack the ability to navigate the complex regulatory and compliance issues that may arise.,0.541687,0.418925
20190411.txt,"Among other requirements, for instance, before a bank partners with a fintech firm, it first has to consider regulatory and supervisory expectations regarding third-party risk management.",0.675613,0.296901

20190411.txt,21 And this may ultimately deter banks from trying to explore how they should be adapting their business strategies in light of technological change.,0.565728,0.414612

20190411.txt,"Here at the Federal Reserve, I think it's vital that we look closely at our work to make sure we are not hindering prudent innovation between community banks and fintech firms.",0.721801,0.569962

20190503.txt,"But while u * and r * provide key reference points in Friedman's framework for assessing how far an economy may be from its long-run equilibrium in labor and financial markets, they play absolutely no role in the monetary policy rule he advocates: his well-known k -percent rule that central banks should aim for and deliver a constant rate of growth of a monetary aggregate.",0.725805,0.458806

20190503.txt,"Although he acknowledged that shocks would push u away from u * (and, implicitly, r away from r *), Friedman felt the role of monetary policy was to operate with a simple quantity rule that did not itself introduce potential instability into the process by which an economy on its own would converge to u * and r *.",0.760888,0.419685
20190503.txt,"4 In Friedman's policy framework, u * and r * are economic destinations, not policy rule inputs.",0.648789,0.188845
20190503.txt,"Of course, I do not need to elaborate for this audience that the history of k -percent rules is that they were rarely tried, and when they were tried in the 1970s and the 1980s, they were found to work much better in theory than in practice.",0.655483,0.385920
20190503.txt,"5 Velocity relationships proved to be empirically unstable, and there was often only a very loose connection between the growth rate of the monetary baseâwhich the central bank could controlâand the growth rate of the broader monetary aggregates, which are more tightly linked to economic activity.",0.574889,0.249011
20190503.txt,"Moreover, the macroeconomic priority in the 1980s in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other major countries was to do ""whatever it takes"" to break the back of inflation and to restore the credibility squandered by central banks that had been unable or unwilling to provide a nominal anchor after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system.",0.537458,0.547949
20190503.txt,"By the early 1990s, the back of inflation had been broken (thank you, Paul Volcker), conditions for price stability had been achieved (thank you, Alan Greenspan), and the time was right for something to fill the vacuum in central bank practice left by the realization that monetary aggregate targeting was not, in practice, a workable monetary policy framework.",0.670185,0.556920
20190503.txt,"Although it was mostly unspoken, there was a growing sense at the time that a simple, systematic framework for central bank practice was needed to ensure that the hard-won gains from breaking the back of inflation were not given away by short-sighted, discretionary monetary experiments that were poorly executed, such as had been the case in the 1970s.",0.699818,0.492651

20190503.txt,"For our purposes today, I will note that the crucial insight of John's paper was that, whereas a central bank could pick the "" k "" in a "" k -percent"" rule on its own, without any reference to the underlying parameters of the economy (including r * and u *), a well-designed rule for setting a short-term interest rate as a policy instrument should, John argued, respect several requirements.",0.744830,0.443986

20190503.txt,"In other words, whereas in Friedman's k -percent policy rule u * and r * are destinations irrelevant to the choice of k , in the Taylor ruleâand most subsequent Taylor-type rulesâ u * and r * are necessary inputs.",0.660329,0.250248

20190503.txt,"The third requirementâthat monetary policy lean against the wind in response to an output or unemployment gapânot only contributes to the objective of price stability, but is also obviously desirable from the perspective of a central bank like the Fed that has a dual mandate.",0.735607,0.575904

20190503.txt,"But, of course, key parameters needed to formulate such rules, including u* and r* , are unknown.",0.662233,0.191869
20190503.txt,"As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should beâand in the United States, I believe, isâdata dependent in a second sense: Policymakers should and do study incoming data and use models to extract signals that enable them to update and improve estimates of r* and u* .",0.703099,0.510977

20190508.txt,3 There are a few key features of that new normal.,0.607300,0.289337
20190508.txt,"For example, interest rates have stayed very low in recent years not only in the United States, but also in many other advanced economies.",0.453918,0.392691

20190508.txt,"But when equilibrium interest rates are low, we have less room to cut interest rates and thus less room to buffer the economy using our conventional tool.",0.684083,0.587140
20190508.txt,"For example, following the most recent recession in 2008 and 2009, we kept interest rates as low as the Committee thought they could go, which was close to zero, for many years.",0.730636,0.382938
20190508.txt,Another big change in the economy is that inflation doesn't move as much with economic activity and employment as it has in the past.,0.658037,0.468953
20190508.txt,This is what economists mean when they say the Phillips curve is very flat.,0.607560,0.252594
20190508.txt,"In many ways, the flatter Phillips curve has advantages: It means that the labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers that may have been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in inflation, unlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s.",0.528752,0.657133
20190508.txt,"Similarly, inflation doesn't fall as much in recessions.",0.573527,0.415741
20190508.txt,But there is an important risk with today's low sensitivity of inflation to slack: It makes it more difficult to boost inflation to our objective of 2 percent on a sustainable basis.,0.721046,0.723012
20190508.txt,"And, as we know from other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the central bank's objective, lower inflation tends to get embedded in people's expectations.",0.704558,0.408152
20190508.txt,"Expectations that inflation will remain low in turn can create a self-fulfilling dynamic with actual inflation, making it even more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation.",0.475491,0.474499

20190508.txt,"While such approaches sound quite appealing on their face, they have not yet been implemented in practice.",0.649511,0.393848
20190508.txt,There is some skepticism that a central bank would in fact prove able to support above-target inflation over a sustained period without becoming concerned that inflation might accelerate and inflation expectations might rise too high.,0.563248,0.833328
20190508.txt,"Another idea I would like to hear more about involves targeting the yield on specific securities so that once the short-term interest rates we traditionally target have hit zero, we might turn to targeting slightly longer-term interest ratesâinitially one-year interest rates, for example, and if more stimulus is needed, perhaps moving out the curve to two-year rates.",0.739829,0.426068
20190508.txt,"Under this policy, the Federal Reserve would stand ready to use its balance sheet to hit the targeted interest rate, but unlike the asset purchases that were undertaken in the recent recession, there would be no specific commitments with regard to purchases of Treasury securities.",0.738727,0.372665

20190509.txt,The conference organizers have sorted through the many research questions that will be addressed today and tomorrow and have taken away three key observations that are fundamental to addressing the challenges related to the middle class.,0.561682,0.327137
20190509.txt,The first observation is to note the long-term decline in relative income growth and upward economic mobility for those in the middle.,0.358577,0.396770
20190509.txt,"According to a number of measures, income has grown more slowly for middle-class households since the 1970s than for those with higher incomes, resulting in wider income inequality.",0.398600,0.512596

20190509.txt,The second observation is the widening gap in economic status and prospects between those with a college degree and those without one.,0.492340,0.367488
20190509.txt,"In the 1960s, well over 90 percent of working-age men held a job, and there was very little difference in employment between those with or without a college degree.",0.517720,0.273975

20190509.txt,"The third observation is that the prospect of moving up the economic ladder depends on factors beyond effort and talent, including your family, the neighborhood you grow up in, and the quality of the primary and secondary schools you attend.",0.605215,0.382921
20190509.txt,"Your chances for attending college are much better if you are raised in a higher-income household, and that advantage has increased substantially since the 1980s.",0.419065,0.648499

At ""Fed Listens: A Capstone Roundtable"" hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York

I am pleased to attend this Fed Listens event providing the New York perspective for the Federal Reserve's review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.",0.533306,0.302091
20190520.txt,1 We are bringing open minds to our review and are seeking a broad range of perspectives.,0.558262,0.362883
20190520.txt,"To us, it simply seems like good institutional practice to engage with a wide range of interested individuals and groups as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability.",0.609885,0.459014
20190520.txt,"2

Motivation for the Review The Congress charged the Federal Reserve with achieving a dual mandateâmaximum employment and price stabilityâand this review will take this mandate as given.",0.667758,0.362345
20190520.txt,We will also take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is the operational goal most consistent with our price-stability mandate.,0.810624,0.666243
20190520.txt,"While we believe that our existing strategy, tools, and communications practices have generally served the public well, we are eager to evaluate ways they might be improved.",0.442185,0.687977
20190520.txt,"With the U.S. economy operating at or close to our maximum-employment and price-stability goals, now is an especially opportune time for this review.",0.704759,0.541030
20190520.txt,"The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.",0.444253,0.422785
20190520.txt,We want to ensure that we continue to meet our statutory goals in coming years.,0.619885,0.647436
20190520.txt,"In addition, we will evaluate the new policy tools and enhanced communication practices the Federal Reserve deployed in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession.",0.575678,0.589044
20190520.txt,"Furthermore, the U.S. and foreign economies have evolved significantly since before the crisis.",0.464322,0.673316
20190520.txt,"Perhaps most importantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United States and abroad.",0.279156,0.478473
20190520.txt,"3 This global decline in neutral rates is widely expected to persist for years and likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth.",0.326133,0.261163
20190520.txt,"These factors' contributions are highly uncertain, but, irrespective of their precise role, the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important.",0.689259,0.537818
20190520.txt,"All else being equal, a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank's policy rate will reach its effective lower bound in future economic downturns.",0.400483,0.513083
20190520.txt,"That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support household spending, business investment, and employment and keep inflation from falling too low.",0.684302,0.720114
20190520.txt,"4

Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.",0.565913,0.640104
20190520.txt,"5 This change is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.",0.629287,0.388473
20190520.txt,It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâas was the case during and after the Great Recessionâbecause a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when inflation is less responsive to employment conditions.,0.671687,0.723019
20190520.txt,"6 However, that dynamic also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.",0.377374,0.578023
20190520.txt,"Thus, it is all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.",0.759168,0.695861
20190520.txt,"7

Finally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to the full employment leg of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.",0.559767,0.654751
20190520.txt,"The unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent in April, has been interpreted by many observers as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.",0.213361,0.202352
20190520.txt,"However, the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be estimated.",0.702464,0.230653
20190520.txt,The range of plausible estimates likely extends at least as low as the current level of the unemployment rate.,0.692365,0.340025
20190520.txt,"For example, in the March Blue Chip economic outlook survey, the average estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for the bottom 10 respondents was 3.9 percent, as compared with 4.7 percent for the highest 10 respondents.",0.305303,0.270194
20190520.txt,"8

The decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working years.",0.294624,0.636002
20190520.txt,9 These increases in participation have provided employers with a significant source of additional labor input and may be one factor restraining inflationary pressures.,0.334604,0.746684
20190520.txt,"As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain.",0.623592,0.619085
20190520.txt,The strong job gains of recent years also has delivered benefits to groups that have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market.,0.233464,0.714429
20190520.txt,"For example, African Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.",0.167729,0.313116
20190520.txt,"10 However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.",0.305007,0.766811
20190520.txt,"11 Likewise, although unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they are for their more-educated counterparts, these gaps appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.",0.358990,0.699050
20190520.txt,12 And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.,0.298925,0.636172

At ""Developments in Empirical Macroeconomics,"" a research conference sponsored by  the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Washington, D.C.",0.581411,0.267046
20190530.txt,"Thank you for the opportunity to take part in today's ""Developments in Empirical Macroeconomics"" conference.",0.552023,0.392089
20190530.txt,I would like to use my time here to talk about a topic of interest to many central bankers and macroeconomists: the interaction of monetary policy and financial stability.,0.636288,0.362511
20190530.txt,"As you well know, monetary policy has powerful effects on financial markets, the financial system, and the broader economy.",0.612227,0.331700
20190530.txt,"Conversely, financial instability, by impairing the provision of credit and other financial services, can depress economic growth, cause job losses, and push inflation too low.",0.240938,0.194668
20190530.txt,"Accordingly, financial stability, through its effects on the Federal Reserve's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices, must be a consideration in the setting of monetary policy.",0.781749,0.557875
20190530.txt,"Against this backdrop, a naturalâyet quite complexâquestion is whether monetary policy should be used to promote financial stability.",0.706284,0.408272
20190530.txt,"This question is hotly debated in a large and growing academic literature, and any serious answer has to be subject to considerable nuance.",0.678473,0.334154
20190530.txt,"At the same time, my sense is that the balance is clearly tilted toward the conclusion that macroprudential policiesâthrough-the-cycle resilience, stress tests, and the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)âmay be better targeted to promoting financial stability than monetary policy.",0.656685,0.736538
20190530.txt,"1

Before I wade into the lessons from past research and experience, I would like to highlight that this question is not just academic.",0.612623,0.221854
20190530.txt,"As you know, the economy, monetary policy, and financial stability are intertwined.",0.631287,0.257807
20190530.txt,"For example, the past three recessions were preceded by some combination of elevated asset prices, rapid increases in borrowing by businesses and households, and excessive risk-taking in the financial sector.",0.405799,0.322069
20190530.txt,These financial vulnerabilities have amplified adverse shocks to the overall economy time and again.,0.431519,0.508842
20190530.txt,"Such concerns have resurfaced among some observers, as the current long expansion has brought business borrowing to new heights.",0.310185,0.694710
20190530.txt,"My own assessment is that even though business debt is elevated, at least by some measures, overall financial stability risks are not, as the financial sector has substantial loss-absorbing capacity and is not overly reliant on unstable short-term funding.",0.652624,0.707458
20190530.txt,"Yet, even if the risk of financial system disruption does not seem high, it well remain true that if the economy weakens, some businesses may default on this debt, potentially leading to a contraction in investment, a slow-down in hiring, and possibly to an unusual tightening in financial conditions.",0.258406,0.280025
20190530.txt,These concerns highlight how cyclical factors influencing monetary policy borrowers may overlap with financial stability considerations.,0.678022,0.382396
20190530.txt,How Monetary Policy Can Influence Financial Stability Let me begin by laying out how monetary policy can influence financial stability.,0.613615,0.210565
20190530.txt,"Monetary policy, operating primarily through adjustments in the level of short-term interest rates, has powerful effects on the entire financial system.",0.611966,0.403505
20190530.txt,A more accommodative monetary policy lowers interest rates across the maturity spectrum.,0.617028,0.616770
20190530.txt,"The textbook result is that mortgage rates and corporate borrowing rates, among others, decline; equity prices rise; and the dollar exchange rate depreciates.",0.259619,0.291255
20190530.txt,"In other words, financial conditions broadly ease, spurring households to buy more and businesses to invest and hire, thereby supporting economic growth and price stability.",0.230645,0.747514
20190530.txt,"2

Monetary policy, however, if too accommodative, may lead to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities.",0.344709,0.261161
20190530.txt,These incentives arrive through a number of channels.,0.576998,0.198555
20190530.txt,"For instance, low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, and so may prompt businesses and households to overborrow.",0.463408,0.485301
20190530.txt,"Low rates may lead to a speculative bubble by compressing risk premiums for assetsâsuch as equity, corporate bonds, and housingâand potentially leading investors to extrapolate price gains into the future in a bout of irrational exuberance.",0.384793,0.354223
20190530.txt,Low rates may also squeeze the profitability of financial intermediaries through narrow interest margins and other factors.,0.228089,0.186517
20190530.txt,"In turn, these intermediaries as well as investors that had promised fixed nominal rates of returnâsuch as insurance companies and pension fundsâmay ""reach for yield,"" or take on more credit or duration risk in their portfolios in order to maintain high returns.",0.657329,0.457534
20190530.txt,"Taken to extremes, this story often does not end well.",0.504482,0.182168
20190530.txt,"Periods of excessive leverage, rapid credit growth, or buoyant credit market sentiment increase the risk to economic growth.",0.555764,0.414694
20190530.txt,"3

These dynamics point to the possibility that accommodative monetary policy, while necessary to support activity during the early stages of an economic expansion, may also increase vulnerabilities in the financial system, especially if maintained for too long.",0.384590,0.458004
20190530.txt,"These vulnerabilities weaken the financial system's ability to absorb negative shocks, and so when a shock arrives, losses mount, the financial system weakens, lending slows, and economic activity slows by more than it would have otherwise, potentially leading to an economic downturn or a more severe recession.",0.224368,0.114048
20190530.txt,Should Financial Vulnerabilities Affect the Stance of Monetary Policy?,0.654264,0.243839
20190530.txt,These observations lead to the important question of whether and how financial vulnerabilities should affect the setting of monetary policy.,0.745959,0.345046
20190530.txt,One simple framework for evaluating the tradeoffs associated with actively setting monetary policy to lean against the buildup of financial vulnerabilities is to examine the costs and benefits of such a policy in terms of unemployment and inflation.,0.741908,0.464348
20190530.txt,"In this approach, the costs of tightening monetary policy in response to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities are lower employment and potentially below target inflation in the near term.",0.316337,0.421907
20190530.txt,"The benefits are possibly reducing the risk of a future financial crisis, an event likely associated with a much larger fall in employment and inflation.",0.271499,0.793663
20190530.txt,One view is that monetary policy curbs household and business borrowing only modestly but can boost the unemployment rate notably.,0.430013,0.765806
20190530.txt,And so using monetary policy to damp borrowing does more harm than good.,0.481193,0.390900
20190530.txt,"According to this view, using monetary policy to lean against financial vulnerabilities does not generate significant net benefits and may be counterproductiveâincreasing unemployment and decreasing inflation below a desired level with little reduction in risks to financial stability.",0.573453,0.751623
20190530.txt,"4

At the same time, some research has identified circumstances under which the benefits of using monetary policy to lean against financial vulnerabilities could outweigh the costs.",0.548733,0.714219
20190530.txt,"5 A key consideration is the estimated amount of economic activity lost in a financial crisisâand some research suggests such losses may be quite large, which raises the benefits of leaning against imbalances.",0.507431,0.470513
20190530.txt,"Similarly, monetary policy may affect a broad range of financial imbalancesâexcessively high house or equity prices and leverage within the financial sectorâand the full set of these effects could shift the risk of financial instability sufficiently, at least under some circumstances, to make leaning against financial vulnerabilities with monetary policy desirable.",0.655589,0.693169
20190530.txt,The broader point is that we do not fully understand the costâbenefit tradeoff and whether monetary policy adjustments for financial stability reasons may be appropriate at some times.,0.776542,0.470847
20190530.txt,Whither Macroprudential Policy?,0.578972,0.210032
20190530.txt,"Of course, there is one additional and critical factor to consider when weighing adjustments to the stance of monetary policy for financial stability reasons: the availability and efficacy of other instruments to promote financial stability.",0.752965,0.496731
20190530.txt,"After all, the pursuit of multiple goalsâfull employment, price stability, and financial stability, for exampleâlikely requires multiple tools.",0.638779,0.269086
20190530.txt,This is just common sense.,0.579938,0.136721
20190530.txt,Economists have a name for this common-sense notion: the Tinbergen principle.,0.638002,0.273388
20190530.txt,"Effective supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential policy tools appear to be well placed to address financial vulnerabilities.",0.588546,0.555488
20190530.txt,"In particular, these tools may be used to increase the resilience of the financial sector against a broad range of adverse shocks and, perhaps, lean against the buildup of specific financial vulnerabilities.",0.591194,0.662105
20190530.txt,"At the Federal Reserve, we have emphasized a set of structural, or through-the-cycle, regulatory and supervisory policies as our primary macroprudential tools to promote financial stability.",0.717411,0.497048
20190530.txt,"These measures include strong capital and liquidity requirements for banks, especially the largest and most systemic institutions.",0.554507,0.719898
20190530.txt,"In addition, our supervisory stress tests evaluate the ability of large banks to weather severe economic stress and the failure of their largest counterparty as well as examining the riskâmanagement practices of the firms.",0.628827,0.417022
20190530.txt,"Moreover, the stress-test scenarios are designed to generally be more severe during buoyant economic periods when vulnerabilities may build.",0.758380,0.508128
20190530.txt,"Furthermore, our stress tests consider the potential effects of specific risks we have identified in our financial stability monitoring work.",0.700954,0.508252
20190530.txt,"For example, the tests in recent years have included hypothetical severe strains in corporate debt markets, exploring the resilience of the participating banks to the risks associated with the increase in business borrowing.",0.647654,0.665169
20190530.txt,"In addition, the Federal Reserve monitors a wide range of indicators for signs of potential risks to financial stability that may merit a policy response, and we now publish a summary of this monitoring in our semiannual Financial Stability Report .",0.723371,0.436102
20190530.txt,"If vulnerabilities are identified as being meaningfully above normal, the Federal Reserve can require large banks to increase their loss-absorbing capacity through increases in the CCyB.",0.558843,0.733857
20190530.txt,"6

Despite all of these efforts, we understand that these tools have limitations.",0.654494,0.526703
20190530.txt,"First, central bankers' experience with macroprudential tools, including the CCyB, is limited.",0.674318,0.249482
20190530.txt,"Second, regulation and macropudential tools can reduce economic efficiency and hamper economic growth by limiting the ability of the market to allocate financial resources.",0.274623,0.094824
20190530.txt,"For this reason, the Federal Reserve has been evaluating ways in which our supervisory and financial stability goals can be achieved more efficiently, and it has been participating in global efforts to evaluate the effects of reforms under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board.",0.522185,0.685803
20190530.txt,"Third, macroprudential policies that are targeted to banks may create an incentive for financial intermediation to migrate outside of the regulated banking system.",0.659684,0.492233
20190530.txt,"The vulnerabilities may still emerge, albeit elsewhere in the financial systemâperhaps in institutions or structures that are less stable and resilient than our banks.",0.531955,0.270786
20190530.txt,"In part reflecting these incentives, we regularly monitor financial intermediation both inside and outside of the banking system.",0.712473,0.426026
20190530.txt,"Summary To sum up, while there is evidence that financial vulnerabilities have the potential to translate into macroeconomic risks, a general consensus has emerged that monetary policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for unemployment and inflation and not by the state of financial vulnerabilities.",0.764403,0.559730
20190530.txt,"Financial system resilience, supported by strong through-the-cycle regulatory and supervisory policies, remains a key defense against financial system and macroeconomic shocks.",0.513348,0.697677

20190530.txt,"2 In anticipation of that milestone, I would like to take stock of where the U.S. economy is today, to assess its future trajectory, to review some important structural changes in the economy that have occurred over the past decade, and to explore what all of this might mean for U.S. monetary policy.",0.685207,0.443534

I am delighted to be in Helsinki at this important conference on monetary policy and the future of Europe's monetary union.",0.520896,0.347659
20190701.txt,1 Today I would like to discuss the broad review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework that my fellow policymakers and I are undertaking this year.,0.687811,0.373291
20190701.txt,"We are examining the policy strategy, tools, and communication practices that we use to pursue our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.",0.724631,0.441686
20190701.txt,"In my remarks, I will describe the motivation for and scope of this review and discuss some of the events that are taking place.",0.619857,0.167023
20190701.txt,"In our review, we are being transparent and open minded, and we are seeking perspectives from a broad range of interested individuals and groups, including academics, other specialists, and the public at large.",0.616544,0.403292
20190701.txt,Motivation for the Review The fact that the Federal Reserve is conducting this review does not suggest that we are dissatisfied with the existing policy framework.,0.731091,0.490215
20190701.txt,"Indeed, we believe our existing framework has served us well, helping us effectively achieve our statutorily assigned dual-mandate goals.",0.284490,0.665137
20190701.txt,"Nonetheless, in light of the unprecedented events of the past decade, we believe it is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain these goals as consistently and robustly as possible.",0.490481,0.696892
20190701.txt,"2 I note that central banks in other countries have conducted periodic reviews of their monetary policy frameworks, and their experience has informed the approach we are pursuing.",0.710925,0.477651
20190701.txt,"With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.",0.716686,0.506947
20190701.txt,"The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.",0.428994,0.472852
20190701.txt,"By conducting this review, we are ensuring that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in coming years.",0.466103,0.717277
20190701.txt,"In addition, the Federal Reserve used new policy tools and enhanced its communications in response to the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession, and the review is evaluating these changes.",0.570175,0.648644
20190701.txt,"Furthermore, U.S. and foreign economies have significantly evolved since the pre-crisis experience that informed much of the research that provided the foundation for our current approach.",0.570951,0.585659
20190701.txt,"Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest ratesâor r*âappear to have fallen in the United States and abroad.",0.372883,0.538952
20190701.txt,"3 Moreover, this global decline in r* is widely expected to persist for years.",0.426980,0.524810
20190701.txt,"The decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors, including aging populations, changes in risk-taking behavior, and a slowdown in technology growth.",0.390337,0.341491
20190701.txt,"These factors' contributions are highly uncertain, but, irrespective of their precise role, the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important.",0.689259,0.537818
20190701.txt,"All else being equal, a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank's policy rate will reach its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.",0.390340,0.534030
20190701.txt,"That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment, and keep inflation from falling too low.",0.648651,0.753749
20190701.txt,"4

Another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack.",0.569171,0.650613
20190701.txt,"That is, the short-run Phillips curve appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.",0.482991,0.558378
20190701.txt,"5 A flatter Phillips curve is, in a sense, a proverbial double-edged sword.",0.615732,0.416739
20190701.txt,It permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâas was the case during and after the Great Recessionâbecause a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.,0.674959,0.724581
20190701.txt,"6 However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.",0.343198,0.589842
20190701.txt,"Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.",0.748023,0.747415
20190701.txt,"7

Finally, the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to full employment.",0.506272,0.679368
20190701.txt,"The unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6 percent in May, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.",0.211646,0.199077
20190701.txt,"However, the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be estimated.",0.702464,0.230653
20190701.txt,I believe the range of plausible estimates extends to 4 percent or below.,0.700174,0.450330
20190701.txt,"For example, in the Summary of Economic Projections submitted in conjunction with the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the range of estimates for the longer-run normal unemployment rate is 3.6 to 4.5 percent.",0.556374,0.215095
20190701.txt,"8

The decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working years.",0.294624,0.636002
20190701.txt,9 These increases in prime-age participation have provided employers with a source of additional labor input and have been one factor restraining inflationary pressures.,0.336444,0.740968
20190701.txt,"As with the unemployment rate, whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain.",0.623592,0.619085
20190701.txt,The strong job gains of recent years also have delivered benefits to groups that have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market.,0.216485,0.708209
20190701.txt,"For example, African Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.",0.167729,0.313116
20190701.txt,"10 However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and there is some indication of an extra benefit to these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory.",0.305007,0.766811
20190701.txt,"11 Likewise, although unemployment rates for less-educated workers are persistently higher than they are for their more-educated counterparts, such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.",0.357344,0.678419
20190701.txt,12 And wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.,0.298925,0.636173
20190701.txt,"13

Scope of the Review In the Federal Reserve Act, the Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the responsibility to conduct monetary policy ""so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""",0.707946,0.461758
20190701.txt,14 Our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate.,0.759539,0.456833
20190701.txt,Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.,0.712840,0.385419
20190701.txt,"15 First adopted in January 2012, the statement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year, including at the FOMC's meeting this past January with unanimous support from all 17 FOMC participants.",0.613462,0.467449
20190701.txt,The statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.,0.668249,0.678750
20190701.txt,"In doing so, the FOMC recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.",0.641564,0.330407
20190701.txt,"According to the Federal Reserve Act, the employment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation objective.",0.716709,0.455717
20190701.txt,"As a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known in the research literature as ""flexible inflation targeting.""",0.711839,0.387874
20190701.txt,"16 However, the Fed's mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedent over the other.",0.746771,0.367565
20190701.txt,We believe this transparency about the balanced approach the FOMC takes has served us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary policies that entailed some risk of inflation.,0.630340,0.722231
20190701.txt,"The review of our current framework is wide ranging, and we are not prejudging where it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions.",0.642119,0.251773
20190701.txt,"Three Questions The first question is, ""Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?""",0.705486,0.432082
20190701.txt,"Under our current approach as well as that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks around the world, the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that many advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as ""bygones.""",0.507603,0.286545
20190701.txt,This means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls with future overshoots of the inflation target (nor do persistent overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target).,0.740952,0.402459
20190701.txt,"Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the ELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely.",0.538833,0.612545
20190701.txt,Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become anchored below the stated inflation goal.,0.354766,0.191331
20190701.txt,"17

In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo, in part or in whole, past inflation deviations from target.",0.698978,0.541340
20190701.txt,"Such strategies include targeting average inflation over a multiyear period and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.",0.750988,0.483982
20190701.txt,18 These strategies could be implemented either permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances.,0.672049,0.338464
20190701.txt,"For example, the central bank could commit, at the time when the policy rate reaches the ELB, to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the ELB period has, on average, run at the target rate.",0.809551,0.450891
20190701.txt,19 Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.,0.724395,0.709704
20190701.txt,"20 In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and thereby, viewed over time, provide no conflict between the dual-mandate goals.",0.513695,0.667015
20190701.txt,"21

The benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comesâfor example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent.",0.593471,0.642506
20190701.txt,"As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not warrant doing so.",0.738423,0.320582
20190701.txt,"Because of this time inconsistency, any makeup strategy, to be successful, would have to be understood by the public to represent a credible commitment.",0.711556,0.454630
20190701.txt,"That important real-world consideration is often neglected in the academic literature, in which central bank ""commitment devices"" are simply assumed to exist and be instantly credible on decree.",0.634334,0.141662
20190701.txt,"Thus, one of the most challenging questions is whether the Fed could, in practice, attain the benefits of makeup strategies that are possible in models.",0.644282,0.442424
20190701.txt,"The next question the review will consider is, ""Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?",0.681420,0.528598
20190701.txt,"And, if so, how?""",0.506229,0.186826
20190701.txt,The FOMC's primary means of changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal funds rate.,0.809604,0.414767
20190701.txt,"In December 2008, the FOMC cut that target to just above zero in response to financial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions.",0.381705,0.336334
20190701.txt,"Because the U.S. economy required additional policy accommodation after the ELB was reached, the FOMC deployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis: balance sheet policies and forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate.",0.716093,0.476110
20190701.txt,"22

The FOMC altered the size and composition of the Fed's balance sheet through a sequence of three large-scale securities purchase programs, via a maturity extension program, and by adjusting the reinvestment of principal payments on maturing securities.",0.670737,0.358961
20190701.txt,"With regard to forward guidance, the FOMC initially made ""calendar based"" statements, and, later on, it issued ""outcome based"" guidance.",0.679097,0.218437
20190701.txt,"Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by strengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent.",0.245319,0.749301
20190701.txt,"That said, estimates of the effects of these unconventional policies range widely.",0.579163,0.231787
20190701.txt,"23

In addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, we will examine additional tools to ease policy when the ELB is binding.",0.648226,0.550249
20190701.txt,"During the crisis and its aftermath, the Federal Reserve considered but ultimately found some of the tools deployed by foreign central banks wanting relative to the alternatives it did pursue.",0.650196,0.537684
20190701.txt,But the review will reassess the case for these and other tools in light of more recent experience in other countries.,0.585859,0.570446
20190701.txt,"The third question the review will consider is, ""How can the FOMC's communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?""",0.609084,0.529823
20190701.txt,"Our communication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal Reserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting.",0.612185,0.461526
20190701.txt,"Over the past decade or so, the FOMC has enhanced its communication practices both to promote public understanding of its policy goals, strategy, and actions and to foster democratic accountability.",0.426692,0.630620
20190701.txt,"These enhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the principles and strategy guiding the Committee's normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants' economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.",0.677575,0.269869
20190701.txt,"24

As part of the review, we will assess the Committee's current and past communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful.",0.597561,0.311488
20190701.txt,"For example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability.",0.590408,0.484331

At ""Stress Testing: A Discussion and Review,"" a research conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Boston, Massachusetts

Thank you Eric, and thank you to everyone at the Boston Fed and throughout the system who have contributed to this conference.",0.486017,0.300513
20190709.txt,"This gathering comes a few weeks after the announcement of this year's stress test results, so let me begin by recounting the highlights of those results.",0.567445,0.168973
20190709.txt,They show that our financial system remains resilient and that capital planning by banks continues to improve.,0.280597,0.736951
20190709.txt,"The largest and most complex banks were tested against a severe hypothetical recession and retained strong capital levels, well above their minimum requirements.",0.233628,0.726585
20190709.txt,They demonstrated the ability to withstand a severe and lasting economic downturn and still be able to lend to households and businesses.,0.389552,0.734779
20190709.txt,"Additionally, most firms are now meeting the high expectations we have set to make sure capital planning takes into account their specific risks and vulnerabilities.",0.601397,0.683703
20190709.txt,This is an improvement from last year.,0.179702,0.684227
20190709.txt,"Overall, these results are good news that confirm our financial system is significantly stronger than before the crisis.",0.227929,0.722626
20190709.txt,"Now let me turn to the purpose of this conference, which is to sharpen our understanding of the experience gained from stress testing and apply these lessons to think about the future.",0.623239,0.423160
20190709.txt,"And let me begin by acknowledging thatânotwithstanding our openness to learning from the collective experience of all of us in this roomâthe future of stress testing will, in a number of important ways, necessarily resemble the past.",0.678993,0.386754
20190709.txt,"For example, we're still going to have them.",0.555071,0.384899
20190709.txt,"Over the course of the last 18 months, I have heard overwhelminglyâfrom academics, from think tanks of every stripe, from banks of every size, from regulatory colleagues both domestic and foreignâthat stress tests should continue to be a key element of the Federal Reserve's supervision of systemically important banks and a key aspect of the Fed's efforts to promote financial stability.",0.673789,0.461370
20190709.txt,"Stress tests should be regular, rigorous, and dynamic.",0.709862,0.345245
20190709.txt,And the banks' performance on these tests will continue to be the most risk sensitive and consequential assessment of the affected banks' capital requirements.,0.683227,0.614693
20190709.txt,"Transparency around the stress testing process and results was a fundamental principle of the first stress test and every one that has followed, and it will remain a primary goal.",0.655319,0.352298
20190709.txt,"Stress tests, as ever, will provide the public with essential information to assess the health of banks and the overall financial system.",0.641993,0.414682
20190709.txt,"To be credible, stress tests will also continue to provide significant information about how the Fed does its work, so the public can understand the rigor and independence of our assessment process and how we come to our judgment of the firms we test.",0.647787,0.407566
20190709.txt,"Fidelity to these principles, embraced in the depths of the crisis by the first stress test a decade ago, does not mean that stress testing should never change or that it hasn't changed over the years.",0.684422,0.366673
20190709.txt,We have learned from our experiences with the early tests and added useful features and adjustments.,0.510206,0.559800
20190709.txt,"These include a counterparty default scenario, as well as a number of policy statements that more explicitly convey the principles we find important in a sensible stress testing program.",0.646555,0.251553
20190709.txt,"Stress testing has evolved, and must continue to evolve, to take on what we as supervisors learn from our work and what we can learn from others.",0.649329,0.371241
20190709.txt,"Each year, we have refined both the substance and the process of the stress tests, guided by our own experience and by critiques and suggestions from others.",0.633371,0.355114
20190709.txt,"This feedback comes from a variety sources, including conferences such as this one, and I am confident that the presentations today will provide insights that result in improvements in our stress tests.",0.401355,0.643151
20190709.txt,"If stress tests are to continue to be relevant and effective, I strongly believe that they must continue to change: they must respond to changes in the economy, the financial system, and the risk-management capabilities of firms.",0.747775,0.603676
20190709.txt,"Evolutionary change has been a consistent principle of stress testing since the beginning, embraced by my predecessors at the Board of Governors and our supervisory staff and reflected in each cycle of tests.",0.618698,0.369892
20190709.txt,"Without such adjustments, regulators, banks, and the broader public cannot get a clear and dynamic view of the capital positions of the largest banks.",0.673297,0.269640
20190709.txt,Stress tests each year have upheld the original principle of transparency around the capital adequacy of our largest banks.,0.503836,0.469063
20190709.txt,"Stress tests results should allow investors, counterparties, analysts and markets to make more informed judgments about the condition of banks.",0.617714,0.448173
20190709.txt,"Along with other regulatory measures, this transparency increases market discipline and it subjects the Federal Reserve to greater outside scrutiny and analysis.",0.628319,0.578176
20190709.txt,"Accountability is important not only for the usual reasons that apply in a democracy but also, in this case, because stress tests can only be effective when the public has confidence in the Fed's evaluation of the capital adequacy of banks.",0.676476,0.403576
20190709.txt,"In effect, stress tests are also a test of the Fed's supervision of large banks.",0.674455,0.244168
20190709.txt,"In these remarks, I will first sketch out how changes in regulation, risk management, the economy, and overall financial stability have prompted alterations to stress tests over the past decade.",0.694175,0.360753
20190709.txt,"Much of that change has enhanced transparency, which is a founding principle for stress tests.",0.419593,0.647673
20190709.txt,I will then suggest some ways in which the effectiveness of stress testing can be further enhanced with greater transparency.,0.543616,0.546738
20190709.txt,"Ten years ago, in May of 2009, the Fed and the Treasury Department released the first stress test results under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP).",0.604913,0.368542
20190709.txt,"At that moment, the U.S. economy was in free fall.",0.332370,0.239538
20190709.txt,The United States had lost an astonishing three million jobs in the previous four months.,-0.000894,-0.033353
20190709.txt,One significant reason for these losses was that many businesses were severely constrained in their access to funding and found it impossible to predict when that access might improve.,0.282429,0.269173
20190709.txt,The goal of the first test was urgent and simple: to restore confidence in the 19 large banks that then accounted for two-thirds of the assets in the banking system.,0.587908,0.492664
20190709.txt,"In fact, simply announcing in March that there would be tests helped stabilize bank finances.",0.406644,0.768261
20190709.txt,"That improvement continued after the results in May outlined the quite feasible steps for raising additional capital that the banks would need to take, and did take, to be able to continue lending if adverse conditions continued.",0.280607,0.737840
20190709.txt,"Challenging conditions did continue, but the stress tests and other actions taken in the first half of 2009 marked a turning point.",0.514937,0.660024
20190709.txt,"The recovery from the Great Recession began in July, as the financial system came back to life, and then steadily strengthened.",0.336221,0.684842
20190709.txt,The principles that made that first test so effective were independence and transparency.,0.592363,0.305130
20190709.txt,"For the first time, an independent authority, the Federal Reserve, would seek to independently assess risks.",0.637302,0.338455
20190709.txt,"1 Just as important, the details of that assessment would be shared with the public, an extent of transparency that until then wasn't characteristic of bank supervision but would become the hallmark of the regulatory framework erected in response to the crisis.",0.627849,0.388576
20190709.txt,"The first tests relied heavily on banks' internal risk models, but they still represented a huge step in independence in providing the public with an assessment of the health and resiliency of large banks.",0.563978,0.529361
20190709.txt,Transparency facilitated both market discipline and accountability.,0.596998,0.400023
20190709.txt,The information provided to the public under the SCAP stress test reinforced the entire enterprise of estimating the capital shortfall faced by major banks.,0.508089,0.495280
20190709.txt,It held the banks accountable for information on their capital adequacy and required them to fill the capital hole.,0.506376,0.099725

Governor Michelle W. Bowman

At a Fed Listens Event sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri

In keeping with the purpose of Fed Listens, I would like to spend most of our time in conversation, but I do want to offer a few thoughts about why the Fed is reaching out to seek a broad range of views, and what we are trying to achieve.",0.630706,0.281147
20190904.txt,This kind of comprehensive outreach on monetary policy is new for the Fed.,0.596313,0.376484
20190904.txt,"For many decades, there was a sense at the Board that the public wasn't interested or willing to dive into the complexities of monetary policy.",0.624387,0.164865
20190904.txt,"That view has changed in a fundamental way, especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis when it was urgently important that the public understand what we were doing.",0.699458,0.426917
20190904.txt,So we began explaining as accessibly and clearly as we could what we were doing and why.,0.630790,0.201366
20190904.txt,Now we are listening broadly as well.,0.611096,0.432395
20190904.txt,"Since I became a Board member almost a year ago, it's become clear to me that people not only are willing to engage on complex economic issues, they also want to know that their concerns are being taken into account on issues that affect their financial well-being.",0.681911,0.436333
20190904.txt,"The movement toward greater transparency and public engagement is ongoing, and advancing that effort is one of my top priorities.",0.605006,0.463422

20190904.txt,How we reach those goals is what is up for discussion.,0.644150,0.256808

20190904.txt,Or would that threaten the decades of success the Fed has had keeping the public's expectations for inflation low and stable?,0.597096,0.428676

Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles

At Program on International Financial Systems Conference, Frankfurt, Germany

Introduction Thanks to the Program on International Financial Systems and the European Central Bank for the opportunity to speak to you today.",0.489901,0.338837
20190905.txt,"I would like to take as my text today this reflection of the 20th-century philosopher, sociologist, and welterweight champion of the world, Oscar de la Hoya: ""There's always room for improvement, no matter how long you've been in the business.""",0.594735,0.316595
20190905.txt,"As all of you know, 2019 marks the 10-year anniversary of our stress testing program in the United States.",0.528921,0.408860
20190905.txt,"In only 10 years, stress tests have developed from an innovative but untested tool to become a well-established element of the Federal Reserve's bank supervision program for large banks.",0.542749,0.485387
20190905.txt,"But developing and running those first tests required a willingness to change, and an openness to innovation, which underlie every advance in human endeavorâwhether banking or boxing.",0.610931,0.363844
20190905.txt,"In that same spirit of being open to change and innovation, my remarks will include some thoughts that might have seemed novel just a few years ago, but in my view, are ideas whose time has now come.",0.662761,0.310890
20190905.txt,"As the Federal Reserve has been considering refinements to our stress testing and capital frameworks, two goals have been at the forefront of our thinking: first, to simplify these frameworks to make them easier to apply and understand, and second, to maintain the overall high level of loss-absorbing capacity in the banking system.",0.640969,0.630902
20190905.txt,Let me expand on those two goals.,0.612520,0.348159
20190905.txt,Goals for Refining Stress Testing and Capital Frameworks One of the great challenges of a regulator is to write rules that are comprehensive and detailed enough to be effective while also being consistent and simple enough to be well understood.,0.639089,0.404817
20190905.txt,There is a well-documented tendency for regulation to grow by accretion.,0.675598,0.533488
20190905.txt,"And with that, there is always a risk that regulatory regimes will become less effective as they grow, developing redundancies and inconsistences that can obscure initial intentions and impair understanding.",0.302661,0.065060
20190905.txt,"This is not a desirable outcome for financial regulation, and indeed, it is the responsibility of any regulator to ensure that the rule frameworks remain well integrated and credible.",0.762159,0.410370
20190905.txt,"Congress has been adjusting the Dodd-Frank Act since its enactment, and, likewise, the Federal Reserve and other regulators have been making adjustments in the wake of the financial crisis to innovations such as stress testing, a public process that in my view has helped make financial oversight more effective.",0.640186,0.552250
20190905.txt,"The thoughts that I am airing in these remarks, part of a public process of discussion and debate, should be seen as a continuation of the review and adjustment that has been taking place since the financial crisis.",0.701918,0.364208
20190905.txt,The goal is to simplify rules that have grown more complex in the past decade and in some cases redundant and harder to understand.,0.577524,0.282475
20190905.txt,"My second goal, in considering these adjustments, is to maintain the high level of loss-absorbing capacity in the U.S. banking system.",0.697738,0.654754
20190905.txt,Our financial system today is far more resilient than it was before the crisis and I want to maintain that resiliency.,0.619344,0.665778
20190905.txt,We are all better served by well-capitalized banks that have the ability to continue lending to households and businesses even during stressful times.,0.505250,0.630594
20190905.txt,"Adjusting regulation in measured ways, such as those I will describe, is an appropriate and, in fact, necessary way to preserve the success we have achieved in strengthening the financial system.",0.645278,0.600726
20190905.txt,"Before I delve into describing the future direction of our stress testing and capital frameworks, allow me to begin with some background on the origins of the stress testing program and an overview of the changes we have made to our capital requirements since the financial crisis.",0.629517,0.304876
20190905.txt,"Background on the Fed's Stress Testing Program At the height of the crisis, as a way to help restore confidence in the largest U.S. banks, the Fed created the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) to estimate potential losses at those banks, if economic and financial conditions worsened.",0.590751,0.471202
20190905.txt,"Building on the success of SCAP, the Board moved to the current stress testing assessment, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), to evaluate whether the largest firms have sufficient capital to continue to lend and absorb potential losses under severely adverse conditions.",0.514760,0.664343
20190905.txt,"At the same time that we were building our stress testing program, we were also making changes to capital rules to address weaknesses observed during the crisis.",0.698471,0.530529
20190905.txt,These included new minimum capital requirements and a capital buffer on top of these requirements.,0.649332,0.529151
20190905.txt,The buffer puts increasingly strict and automatic limits on capital distributions as a bank's capital declines toward the minimum.,0.531911,0.301644
20190905.txt,"Large banks are also subject to a potential countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB), which I will discuss more shortly.",0.721234,0.406159
20190905.txt,And the largest banks are subject to an additional buffer of capital based on a measure of their systemic risk.,0.655347,0.322841
20190905.txt,Stress testing and stronger capital requirements have combined to greatly strengthen the resiliency of the U.S. banking system.,0.202600,0.717353
20190905.txt,"At the banks subject to CCAR, risk-based capital ratios have more than doubled since 2009.",0.209787,0.653644
20190905.txt,"Combined, these firms now have more than $1 trillion of common equity capital, and a ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets of 12.1%, which is many multiples over the required ratio of Tier 1 common in 2009.",0.575062,0.477320
20190905.txt,"As a result of these changes, large U.S. banks are substantially more resilient to stress than in the past.",0.468846,0.755204
20190905.txt,"At the same time, I believe our regulatory measures are most effective when they are as simple and transparent as possible, and it is prudent to periodically review all of our practices to ensure that they are achieving these goals.",0.729693,0.538960
20190905.txt,"Importantly, although CCAR and our regulatory capital requirements share similar ends, they were developed separately, due to the exigencies of the crisis, and this has led to significant redundancies, which I will describe in detail in a moment.",0.697579,0.373060
20190905.txt,"Just to name one prominent example, we now have 24 different requirements for total loss absorbency, while before the financial crisis we had 3.",0.618287,0.280238
20190905.txt,Perhaps there were some benefits to having overlapping approaches when we were still in the capital-building phase after the crisis.,0.604910,0.523402
20190905.txt,"But now that banks have built significant capital stores, I believe the overlapping requirements should be combined for efficiency and simplicity.",0.614937,0.564326
20190905.txt,"The Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) Proposal Last year, the Board issued a proposal to address these redundancies.",0.692305,0.453082
20190905.txt,The proposalâknown as the stress capital bufferâwould simplify our regulatory regime by integrating the stress test with our non-stress capital rules.,0.612357,0.444556
20190905.txt,"I believe the SCB proposal stands as a good example of how our work can be done more efficiently and effectively, and in a way that maintains the resiliency of the financial system.",0.488499,0.666890
20190905.txt,"For large bank holding companies, the SCB would replace the fixed-for-all-times-and-for-all-banks 2.5 percent risk-based capital buffer with a firm-specific buffer based on the firm's most recent stress test results.",0.651936,0.402129
20190905.txt,This would integrate our stress testing capital requirements with our point-in-time capital requirements.,0.610335,0.422980
20190905.txt,"And as a result, the two separate capital frameworks would be combined into one.",0.582645,0.244941
20190905.txt,"Firms would have to manage according to one integrated set of requirements and, when their capital is insufficient, would be required to rebuild their resiliency through one integrated set of limitations on their capital distributions.",0.708975,0.420017
20190905.txt,"Originally, we had planned to make the SCB final for the 2019 stress test cycle.",0.687005,0.286191
20190905.txt,"However, we received thorough and insightful feedback on the proposal that we have been considering carefully.",0.569525,0.582332
20190905.txt,Among the comments we received were many that called for further simplification of the SCB framework.,0.667218,0.436996
20190905.txt,"Based on this feedback, I first would like to emphasize two elements of the 2018 SCB proposal that, in my more considered judgment, I now believe should not be a part of the final SCB framework.",0.702396,0.321501
20190905.txt,"Second, I would like to introduce two new co-equal options, either of which would improve the final product.",0.518603,0.568960
20190905.txt,The first element of the SCB proposal that I believe should be removed is the stress leverage buffer requirement.,0.666958,0.285273
20190905.txt,"1 By its nature, a leverage ratio is a blunt instrument that treats all assets the same and therefore is not risk-sensitive.",0.664233,0.213302
20190905.txt,"Thus, I am concerned that explicitly assigning a stressed leverage requirement to a firm on the basis of risk-sensitive post-stress estimates is in conflict with the intellectual underpinnings of the leverage ratio.",0.603481,0.273395
20190905.txt,"It is what the analytical philosophers call a category mistake: like saying that, ""Freedom has curly hair"".",0.348262,-0.006543
20190905.txt,"Of course, leverage ratios, including the enhanced supplementary leverage requirements, would remain a critical part of our regulatory capital regime, and I believe our existing leverage ratios provide a sufficient backstop to the risk-based capital requirements.",0.635868,0.613421
20190905.txt,"For these reasons, it seems out of place and unnecessary to add a separate leverage capital buffer.",0.485988,0.135347
20190905.txt,"2

The second element of the SCB proposal that I believe should be removed is the requirement for banks to pre-fund the next four quarters of their planned dividend payments.",0.611922,0.244870
20190905.txt,"The stress tests currently require banks to set aside sufficient capital today to ""pre-fund"" expected capital distributions, both dividends and repurchases, for all nine quarters of the capital planning horizon.",0.716035,0.484675
20190905.txt,Removing the pre-funding of dividend requirement would simplify the SCB proposal.,0.725050,0.362052
20190905.txt,"Additionally, the SCB already has a mechanism for curbing dividends and other distributions when a bank's capital ratio falls into the buffer.",0.644566,0.347725
20190905.txt,Requiring pre-funding of dividends is a needless redundancy.,0.281305,0.106416
20190905.txt,"Even worse, the pre-funding of dividends could lead to a conflict with the mechanics of the SCBâthe SCB could call for a restriction of dividend payments even when those payments had been pre-funded.",0.418483,0.114838
20190905.txt,"I believe it is better to focus on the root cause of our concerns and take a comprehensive approach to ensuring that banks have sufficient capital, rather than focus on the individual elements of capital distributions.",0.750418,0.534464
20190905.txt,Some have argued that requiring pre-funding of dividends helps reduce pro-cyclicality.,0.550156,0.715389
20190905.txt,"3 Limiting pro-cyclicality, or being countercyclical, essentially means limiting both the highs and lows of a business cycle.",0.696786,0.318646
20190905.txt,"And there can be value in doing so because, among other things, it can help reduce stress on our financial system.",0.511808,0.672612
20190905.txt,"With a counter-cyclical stress test, as the economy strengthens, the test should get tougher and be more stringent to mitigate the buildup of vulnerabilities during good times.",0.708219,0.712945

20190926.txt,"However, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.",0.458816,0.721084
20190926.txt,"2

With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.",0.712170,0.523161
20190926.txt,"The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.",0.428994,0.472852
20190926.txt,"With this review, we hope to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in coming years.",0.374584,0.716967
20190926.txt,The U.S. and foreign economies have changed in some important ways since the Global Financial Crisis.,0.589171,0.520761
20190926.txt,"Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United States.",0.256304,0.525016
20190926.txt,3 A fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank's policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.,0.243523,0.509832
20190926.txt,"That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far below the 2 percent objective.",0.640537,0.692649
20190926.txt,"4

Another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less responsive to resource slack.",0.588405,0.642839
20190926.txt,"That is, the short-run price Phillips curveâif not the wage Phillips curveâappears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.",0.565146,0.467757
20190926.txt,5 A flatter Phillips curve permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâas was the case during and after the Great Recessionâbecause a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.,0.654895,0.612105
20190926.txt,"6 However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.",0.270075,0.481864
20190926.txt,"Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.",0.750292,0.738868
20190926.txt,"7 And let me emphasize that, based on the evidence I have reviewed, I judge that U.S. inflation expectations today do reside in a range I consider consistent with our priceâstability mandate.",0.721048,0.566966
20190926.txt,"A Robust U.S. Labor Market For some time now, price stability in the United States has coincided with a historically low unemployment rate.",0.393101,0.589024
20190926.txt,"This low unemployment rate, 3.7 percent in August, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.",0.252365,0.265292
20190926.txt,"However, we cannot directly observe the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability, u*, but must infer it from data via models.",0.701164,0.288860
20190926.txt,I myself believe that the range of plausible estimates of u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of 3.7 percent.,0.687004,0.359897
20190926.txt,"As the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the August participation rate at a cycle high of 82.6 percent.",0.313052,0.688781
20190926.txt,"8 Increased prime-age participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures.",0.192460,0.751395
20190926.txt,Whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains to be seen.,0.613489,0.730245
20190926.txt,But I note that prime-age participation still remains below levels seen in previous business cycle expansions.,0.503458,0.513312
20190926.txt,"Also, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages are putting upward pressure on price inflation.",0.499746,0.635967
20190926.txt,Wages today are increasing broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.,0.348531,0.783467
20190926.txt,"Also of note, and receiving less attention than it deserves, is the material increase in labor's share of national income that has occurred in recent years as the labor market has tightened.",0.489325,0.519344
20190926.txt,"As I have written before, there is a cyclical regularity in U.S. data that labor's share tends to rise as expansions endure and the labor market tightens.",0.584730,0.600613
20190926.txt,9 In recent cyclesâand thus far in this cycleâthis rise in labor's share has not put upward pressure on price inflation.,0.507156,0.772950
20190926.txt,The strong job gains of recent years also have delivered benefits to groups that have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market.,0.216485,0.708209
20190926.txt,"For example, African Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.",0.167729,0.313116
20190926.txt,"10 However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and, as President Daly's research shows, there is some indication these groups especially benefit when the unemployment rate remains very low.",0.444584,0.733158
20190926.txt,"11 Likewise, the gaps between unemployment rates for less-educated workers and their more-educated counterparts appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.",0.339354,0.719709
20190926.txt,12 Wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.,0.256677,0.643766

Scope of the Review The Federal Reserve Act assigns to the Fed the responsibility to conduct monetary policy ""so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""",0.669395,0.348211
20190926.txt,14 Our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate.,0.759539,0.456833
20190926.txt,Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.,0.712840,0.385419

20190926.txt,"As a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known as ""flexible inflation targeting.""",0.711571,0.383578
20190926.txt,"16 However, the Fed's mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedence over the other.",0.743456,0.392888
20190926.txt,"The review of our current framework is wide ranging, and we are not prejudging where it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions that we will seek to answer with our review.",0.667789,0.304884

In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.",0.689873,0.541970
20190926.txt,"These strategies include targeting average inflation and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.",0.766550,0.498211

20190927.txt,Considering Macroeconomic Outcomes in Calibrations and Impact Analyses The second paradigm shift is that regulators have improved their methods of conducting quantitative analysis of regulations.,0.462633,0.664672
20190927.txt,"Such analysis, including conventional âcost-benefit analysis, traditionally did not take macroeconomic variables like gross domestic product (GDP) growth or the unemployment rate.",0.697375,0.218404

20191018.txt,"1

The U.S. economy is in a good place, and the baseline outlook is favorable.",0.374651,0.684883
20191018.txt,"The median expectation from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' most recent Summary of Economic Projections is for GDP growth to be around 2 percent in 2019, for growth to continue near this pace next year, and for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to rise gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective.",0.413181,0.795727
20191018.txt,"2 The unemployment rate, at 3.5 percent, is at a half-century low, and wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.",0.447035,0.585898
20191018.txt,There is no evidence to date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost-push pressure on price inflation.,0.437796,0.419447
20191018.txt,"But despite this favorable baseline outlook, the U.S. economy confronts some evident risks in this the 11th year of economic expansion.",0.516555,0.711289
20191018.txt,"Business fixed investment has slowed notably since last year, exports are contracting on a year-over-year basis, and indicators of manufacturing activity are weakening.",0.105539,0.088903
20191018.txt,"Global growth estimates continue to be marked down, and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U.S. inflation.",0.128103,0.083136
20191018.txt,U.S. inflation remains muted.,0.402655,0.558515

20191018.txt,"Turning now to monetary policy, at both its July and September meetings, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.",0.591594,0.471154
20191018.txt,"3 With these decisions, the current target range for the federal funds rate is 1.75 to 2 percent, which compares with the range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent that prevailed between December 2018 and July 2019.",0.717590,0.461867
20191018.txt,The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,0.737033,0.634721
20191018.txt,"Looking ahead, monetary policy is not on a preset course, and the Committee will proceed on a meeting-by-meeting basis to assess the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook, and it will act as appropriate to sustain growth, a strong labor market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective.",0.654510,0.780168
20191018.txt,"Turning now to the framework under which the Federal Reserve operates in financial markets, in September of this year, shocks in the repurchase agreement (repo) market put upward pressure on money market rates, and these pressures spilled over into the federal funds market.",0.365368,0.317708

20191018.txt,"4 In July, the FOMC concluded the program of balance sheet reduction in place since October 2017 and indicated then that, after a time, it would commence increasing its securities holdings to maintain reserves at a level consistent with an ample-reserves regime.",0.569021,0.735884
20191018.txt,"The FOMC announced on October 11 that it would seek to maintain, over time, a level of bank reserves at or somewhat above the level that prevailed in early September, a level that we believe is sufficient to operate an ample-reserves regime.",0.506865,0.769530
20191018.txt,"5 This week, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began a program of purchasing Treasury bills in the secondary market.",0.560372,0.358573

20191018.txt,"In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to conduct term and overnight repo operations at least through January to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of temporary, but pronounced, increases in our nonreserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk that money market pressures adversely affect monetary policy implementation.",0.643109,0.796557
20191018.txt,"It is important to note that the open market operations we have announced are technical, ""Central Banking 101"" operations and should not be conflated with the large-scale asset purchase programs that the Federal Reserve deployed after the financial crisis.",0.705859,0.327594
20191018.txt,"In those programs, the Federal Reserve was seeking to ease financial conditions by lowering term premiums via its purchases of long-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.",0.602283,0.689376
20191018.txt,"By contrast, the program announced on October 11 will concentrate its purchases in Treasury bills.",0.675029,0.371216

Over the course of this afternoon, you will hear a series of presentations that put Hayek's thinking in the context of contemporary developments and that offer a variety of perspectives on his intellectual legacy.",0.541951,0.256833
20191101.txt,Hayek was a prolificâsome might even say profligateâthinker.,0.496996,0.151606
20191101.txt,"He was at various times, and in various modes, an early neuropsychologist, an epistemologist, a theoretical economist, a political philosopher, a moral philosopher, a philosopher of science, a historian of ideas, a public intellectual, and a social polemicist.",0.567987,0.096242
20191101.txt,"This vast range has caused some to undervalue his contributions as an economist, notwithstanding his eventual Nobel Prizeâwhen Hayek moved to the United States in 1950, the University of Chicago Economics Department would not hire him because, as Milton Friedman said, ""At that stage, he really wasn't doing any economics,"" and Paul Krugman famously said that ""the Hayek thing is almost entirely about politics, not economics.""",0.541537,0.207560

20191101.txt,"So as not to appear entirely out of touch with more immediate developments, I will end by descending from the empyrean to the terrestrial with a discussion of the economic outlook and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) policy decision from earlier this week.",0.676203,0.195732

20191101.txt,"3 In addition, Hayek contributed prominently to monetary analysis.",0.595792,0.513869
20191101.txt,His work in this area included the theory of the business cycle that was part of the thinking of the Austrian school of economics.,0.616108,0.165150
20191101.txt,4 It also included Hayek's studies of the feasibility and implications of private-sector currency issuanceâcontributions that have informed modern-day analyses of the repercussions of electronic money.,0.610408,0.270675

With regard to the paper's contribution to the understanding of economic processes, an illuminating discussion was provided in 2005 by Oliver Williamsonâhimself later a Nobel laureate in economics.",0.568087,0.388658
20191101.txt,"Williamson cited Hayek's 1945 paper, along with Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations from the eighteenth century, as forming the core of a ""venerated tradition in economics"" of studying the notion of ""spontaneous order"" arising from a freely operating market system.",0.631201,0.366102

How does Hayek's case for the price system fit in alongside the other work that Williamson mentioned?",0.602224,0.202616
20191101.txt,"As Paul Samuelsonâyet another Nobel Prize winnerâhad occasion to note, the argument for the price system that Hayek articulated in 1945 was complementary with, but distinct from, the argument that Adam Smith espoused in The Wealth of Nations.",0.693029,0.395975
20191101.txt,10 Smith focused on how market mechanisms guide producers toward satisfying consumers' wants.,0.626180,0.347570

Hayek emphasized that the signals transmitted by the various individual prices in the economy could, together, serve as a useful means of guiding overall resource allocation.",0.613283,0.492139
20191101.txt,The reason is that prices convey messages to consumers and producers even when the information that drives prices is not aggregated or directly observed.,0.648709,0.252174
20191101.txt,"12 For example, a large increase or decrease in the price of gasoline conveys information that influences consumer behavior and that also affects the behavior of energy producers, even when neither of these sets of market participants are aware of the precise factor initiating the price change.",0.625058,0.323312
20191101.txt,"As a related matter, Hayek recognized that prices transmit information even in a situation in which much of that information is not explicitly disclosed by one market participant to another, or even consciously articulable by any market participant at all.",0.644952,0.162127
20191101.txt,"Hayek believed that all of us ""know"" many things that we cannot articulate but that we nevertheless act on in practical situations, and the price system can therefore aggregate and transmit that knowledge which we could not otherwise convey.",0.648304,0.321440
20191101.txt,Hayek's analysis had implications for the viability of different economic systems.,0.645346,0.459668
20191101.txt,"With regard to centrally planned economic systemsâwhich had considerable support in the West in 1945, in light of the increased use of government economic controls in many countries during World War II and the dismal performance of market economies during the Great DepressionâHayek's analysis suggested that these systems would likely exhibit great inefficiency.",0.517058,0.509928
20191101.txt,"To Hayek, it was totally unrealistic to expect an economy to operate efficiently if it was based on the ""direction of the whole economic system according to one unified plan,"" as such a plan lacked the valuable information embedded in market-determined prices.",0.641844,0.280917

20191101.txt,"Rather, as already mentioned, we all know many important things that we cannot articulate; and many of these things we come to know precisely through our participation in trade and exchange through the market.",0.632196,0.252957
20191101.txt,"This type of knowledge (a) is by its nature not conveyable to a central planner because we are not fully aware of all we know, and (b) would not even exist apart from the social interactions facilitated by the market which a central planner would replace.",0.630349,0.104856
20191101.txt,"The flip side of Hayek's analysis was that, while there are insurmountable obstacles to economic efficiency via a central plan, an efficient economy may still be obtainable by letting the price system work.",0.654457,0.597889
20191101.txt,"To quote Mankiw again, Hayek's analysis implies that ""markets figure out a way to aggregate, in a decentralized way, dispersed information into desirable outcomes.""",0.613225,0.436050

20191101.txt,18 Hayek's emphasis on prices as processors of information has also had applications to international trade theory.,0.604499,0.367238
20191101.txt,"19 And in macroeconomics and monetary theory, Milton Friedman's Nobel lecture, published in 1977, cited Hayek's 1945 paper when arguing that, because it disrupted the signals arising from relative-price movements, inflation both lowered the efficiency of the economy and led output to deviate from its natural (or full-employment) level.",0.364297,0.298300
20191101.txt,"20 Hayek likened the price mechanism to a ""system of telecommunications,"" and Friedman's description of inflation as a form of ""static"" interrupting price signals was in keeping with this analogy.",0.641453,0.309970

20191101.txt,"The paper has therefore set a high bar for preempting the price system or for other interventions in the market: When economists point to cases in which market mechanisms can be improved on by regulation or other public-sector intervention, or to instances in which price signals do not appear to be operating effectively, they need to identify a specific market failure as the source of the inefficiency.",0.639829,0.336720

20191114.txt,I am delighted to be at the Cato Institute today to participate in your annual monetary conference.,0.534382,0.329017
20191114.txt,The last time I had the privilege of speaking at this conference was in 2004.,0.575329,0.149801
20191114.txt,"This year's conference, ""Fed Policy: A Shadow Review,"" takes up the Federal Reserve's 2019 review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.",0.690622,0.303730
20191114.txt,"This topic is, of course, timely and one to which I and others have devoted much thought over the past year.",0.642961,0.411095
20191114.txt,"1

Motivation for the Review Although I will have more to say about the review in a moment, let me state at the outset that we believe our existing framework, which has been in place since 2012, has served us well and has enabled us to achieve and sustain our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability.",0.468780,0.698391
20191114.txt,"However, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.",0.458816,0.721084
20191114.txt,"2

With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.",0.712170,0.523161
20191114.txt,"The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.",0.428994,0.472852
20191114.txt,"With this review, we hope to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in coming years.",0.374584,0.716967
20191114.txt,The U.S. and foreign economies have changed in some important ways since the Global Financial Crisis.,0.589171,0.520761
20191114.txt,"Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United States.",0.256304,0.525015
20191114.txt,3 A fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank's policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.,0.243523,0.509833
20191114.txt,"That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far below the central bank's objectiveâ2 percent in the case of the Federal Reserve.",0.618906,0.648860
20191114.txt,"4

Another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less responsive to resource slack.",0.588405,0.642839
20191114.txt,"That is, the short-run price Phillips curveâif not the wage Phillips curveâappears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.",0.565146,0.467757
20191114.txt,5 A flatter Phillips curve permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâas was the case during and after the Great Recessionâbecause a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.,0.654895,0.612105
20191114.txt,"6 However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.",0.270075,0.481864
20191114.txt,"Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.",0.750292,0.738868
20191114.txt,"7 Based on the evidence I have reviewed, I judge that U.S. inflation expectations today do reside at the low end of a range I consider consistent with our priceâstability mandate.",0.630794,0.368175
20191114.txt,"A Robust U.S. Labor Market For some time now, price stability in the United States has coincided with a historically low unemployment rate.",0.393101,0.589024
20191114.txt,"This low unemployment rate, 3.6 percent in October, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.",0.249949,0.263599
20191114.txt,"However, we cannot directly observe the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability, u*, but must infer it from data via models.",0.701164,0.288860
20191114.txt,I myself believe that the range of plausible estimates of u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of 3.6 percent.,0.688853,0.359826
20191114.txt,"As the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the October participation rate at a cycle high of 82.8 percent.",0.311757,0.683947
20191114.txt,"8 Increased prime-age participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures.",0.192460,0.751395
20191114.txt,Whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains to be seen.,0.613489,0.730245
20191114.txt,But I note that male prime-age participation still remains below levels seen in previous business cycle expansions.,0.462956,0.502172
20191114.txt,"Also, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages are putting excessive upward pressure on price inflation.",0.479963,0.585373
20191114.txt,Wages today are increasing broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.,0.348531,0.783467

20191114.txt,"As I have written before, labor's share tends to rise as expansions endure and the labor market tightens.",0.579617,0.619154
20191114.txt,9 In recent cyclesâand thus far in this cycleâthis rise in labor's share has not put excessive upward pressure on price inflation.,0.522310,0.785640

20191114.txt,"In doing so, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.",0.613292,0.306907
20191114.txt,"As a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known as ""flexible inflation targeting.""",0.711571,0.383578
20191114.txt,"12 However, the Fed's mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedence over the other.",0.737847,0.384511
20191114.txt,"The review of our current framework is wide ranging, and we are not prejudging where it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions that we will seek to answer with our review.",0.667789,0.304884
20191114.txt,"Three Questions The first question is, ""Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?""",0.705486,0.432082
20191114.txt,"Under our current approach as well as the approaches of many central banks around the world, persistent inflation shortfalls of the target are treated as ""bygones.""",0.613829,0.257783
20191114.txt,"Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the ELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more of a challenge.",0.560472,0.597526
20191114.txt,Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.,0.359869,0.296152
20191114.txt,"13

In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.",0.685814,0.538419
20191114.txt,"These strategies include targeting average inflation and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.",0.766550,0.498211
20191114.txt,14 Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.,0.718185,0.711453
20191114.txt,"15 In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate.",0.444342,0.659478
20191114.txt,"16

The success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comesâfor example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent.",0.608461,0.627457
20191114.txt,"As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not justify that action.",0.731007,0.329140
20191114.txt,"Thus, one of the most important questions we seek to answer in our review is whether the Fed could, in practice, attain the benefits of makeup strategies that are possible in theoretical models.",0.621837,0.472573
20191114.txt,"The next question the review is considering is, ""Are existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?",0.679529,0.521760
20191114.txt,"And, if so, how?""",0.506229,0.186826
20191114.txt,The FOMC's primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate.,0.762251,0.307888
20191114.txt,"In December 2008, the FOMC cut that target to just above zero in response to financial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions.",0.381705,0.336334
20191114.txt,"Because the U.S. economy required additional support after the ELB was reached, the FOMC deployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis: balance sheet policies and forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate.",0.704284,0.504445
20191114.txt,"17

In addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, the review is examining additional tools for easing policy when the ELB is binding.",0.660561,0.495900
20191114.txt,"During the crisis and its aftermath, the Federal Reserve considered some of the tools deployed by other central banks but ultimately found them wanting in the U.S. context.",0.673718,0.439561
20191114.txt,But the review is reassessing the case for these and other tools in light of more recent experience in other countries.,0.564012,0.608593
20191114.txt,"The third question the review is considering is, ""How can the FOMC's communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?""",0.605054,0.528984
20191114.txt,"Our communication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal Reserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting.",0.612185,0.461526
20191114.txt,"Over the past decade or so, the FOMC has enhanced its communication both to promote public understanding of its policy goals, strategy, and actions and to foster democratic accountability.",0.447669,0.618570
20191114.txt,"These enhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the principles and strategy guiding the Committee's normalization of monetary policy following the financial crisis; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants' economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.",0.681692,0.275396

20240227.txt,LTCM was a heavily leveraged hedge fund that had borrowed more than $125 billion from its counterparties and had derivatives estimated at over $1 trillion in notional value.,0.499329,0.149747
20240227.txt,"Stabilizing LTCM narrowly averted significant financial stress, an event I remember vividly from my vantage point as a Treasury official at the time.",0.623646,0.604831
20240227.txt,That event prompted deep reflection on both the risks presented by nonbanks such as hedge funds and the state of counterparty credit risk management practices by banks that finance their activities.,0.536076,0.454334
20240227.txt,"The more recent failure of Archegos Capital Management resulted in over $10 billion of reported losses across several banks and revealed many of the same gaps in how banks manage their exposure to investment funds, which are far larger today than at the time of LTCM's collapse.",0.268687,0.129849
20240227.txt,"Managing these exposures has become more challenging as the financial system has become more complex, diverse, and interconnected.",0.587487,0.341093
20240227.txt,"For example, the sudden rise in commodities prices in March 2022 rippled around the global financial system in part because of the sudden rise in margin requirements on commodities derivatives as the stress hit.",0.407599,0.512371

20240227.txt,"For instance, losses in 2022 in the liability-driven investments of pension funds in the United Kingdom demonstrated how even traditionally safe exposures, such as government bonds, when combined with excessive leverage, can threaten the stability of bank counterparties and the global financial system.",0.344993,0.361893
20240227.txt,These events highlight why counterparty credit risk is such an important risk discipline.,0.640419,0.285502

20240227.txt,"Third, banks should set prudent risk limits and respond to signals of risk appropriately.",0.753487,0.508770
20240227.txt,These risk management practices are important to help control the build-up of riskâpreventing banks and the banking system from taking on outsized exposure to leveraged entities and preventing the build-up of that leverage.,0.667457,0.538289
20240227.txt,"These credit risk management practices are important complements to prudent liquidity risk management and resilience measures, such as contingency planning, in which banks take steps to mitigate the impact of distress of a counterparty to the bank and the financial system more broadly.",0.684041,0.506390
20240227.txt,The Federal Reserve will also use its own tools to assess counterparty credit risk in the banking system.,0.689682,0.339467

20240227.txt,We will conduct that analysis under two different sets of financial market conditions to learn about how such exposures may vary across different types of stresses.,0.660987,0.298268
20240227.txt,We expect the information yielded from that analysis will deepen our supervisory understanding of counterparty credit risk at the banks.,0.433220,0.661615

20240301.txt,"There are three key elements of asset purchases that change the term premium: (1) the expected path of QE, which includes the amount and timing of purchases; (2) the length of time the central bank is expected to hold the additional securities; and (3) the expected path of QT, including the amount and timing of redemptions, which importantly depends on the desired ultimate size of securities holdings (and reserve balances) of the central bank.",0.680967,0.245015
20240301.txt,"As soon as an asset purchase program is announced, these expectations are formed, resulting in the term premium effect, or TPE, on interest rates.",0.680113,0.285094
20240301.txt,"Over time, the TPE will change, based on both the passage of time and any updates to the public's expectations for the components I just mentioned.",0.690509,0.339851
20240301.txt,Let me talk about three factors that affect both the expected path of asset purchases and interest rates.,0.655715,0.234504
20240301.txt,These factors are things to keep in mind for future policy decisions.,0.721853,0.336336
20240301.txt,"First, there are two ways that QE can be implemented, and they have different impacts on interest rates.",0.673325,0.310373
20240301.txt,These are what I call closed - or open-ended QE programs.,0.576676,0.064158
20240301.txt,Closed-ended QE programs involve an announcement of a fixed stock of purchases over a fixed period of time.,0.623141,0.123478
20240301.txt,An example of this type of asset purchase program was initiated by the Fed in March 2009.,0.562932,0.180252
20240301.txt,"4 Open-ended QE simply gives a purchase amount per month but no calendar endpoint, so the expected size of the program is unspecified.",0.644258,0.103044
20240301.txt,"A set of economic conditions for reducing or ending purchases may be stipulated, but when they will occur is not perfectly predictable.",0.722127,0.288341
20240301.txt,"Here, one can think of the Fed's most recent asset purchase program.",0.601511,0.241335
20240301.txt,"At the time of an asset purchase announcement, it will be easier for markets to fully price in a closed-ended program, since its purchase amount and end date are given, whereas the open-ended program's pricing will depend on market expectations for the evolution of the economy.",0.703882,0.318182
20240301.txt,"So if one wants a particular impact on interest rates at the announcement date, one might lean toward a closed-ended program or be aware that additional guidance on the expected path of the open-ended program will be needed.",0.788793,0.438494
20240301.txt,"As time passes and the economy evolves, the two programs work differently.",0.642246,0.222193
20240301.txt,One might prefer an open-ended program over time because it dynamically responds to the evolution of economic conditions.,0.715834,0.415652
20240301.txt,"The program could be halted or extended as conditions improve or worsen, unlike a closed-ended program.",0.460499,0.160968
20240301.txt,"But, of course, the criteria set in the open-ended program must be carefully considered.",0.727670,0.357996
20240301.txt,"As I said in a recent FEDS Note and in several speeches, the 2020 criteria for when to begin QT may have been too restrictive and did not allow the Committee to taper as soon and as gradually as desired.",0.696295,0.264727
20240301.txt,5 Setting the appropriate criteria ahead of time to create the flexibility needed to respond to changing economic and financial conditions is very hard to do.,0.683600,0.337188
20240301.txt,The second factor affecting the path of asset purchases is that it is very important that QE be credibly followed by QT.,0.743633,0.497946
20240301.txt,"If QE is viewed as nothing more than a permanent injection of money into the economy, it would likely create inflation.",0.404207,0.294588
20240301.txt,"This was widely predicted back in 2009, but the inflation didn't happen.",0.603152,0.222955
20240301.txt,Why?,0.451160,0.030657
20240301.txt,"In my view, it didn't happen because the Fed credibly committed to withdrawing the injected reserves at a later date.",0.700916,0.359152
20240301.txt,Pre-committing to QT is what allows the injection of reserves into the economy without inflation or other longer-run distortions of market pricing.,0.696210,0.433129
20240301.txt,"So when starting asset purchases or weighing how to approach asset runoff or sales, it is important that the central bank commit to normalizing its balance sheet.",0.759178,0.510187
20240301.txt,The third factor is that it is important for a central bank to move carefully as it comes to the end of QT and the desired level of ample reserves.,0.778112,0.532631
20240301.txt,The endpoint should be related to the expectation of the banking system's demand for reserves.,0.695979,0.571442
20240301.txt,"In the United States, we saw stresses in money markets in the fall of 2019, when the Fed reduced the level of reserves during balance sheet normalization through July and then there was heavy issuance of Treasury securities in September.",0.387297,0.274754
20240301.txt,The level of reserves likely went a bit too low.,0.530320,0.362270
20240301.txt,6 Learning from our experiences and trying to understand how the demand for reserves has changed over time suggests moving carefully toward the endpoint of QT.,0.704428,0.498779
20240301.txt,"For this reason, even if QE is an open-ended program, QT is more likely to resemble a closed-ended program.",0.690848,0.337038
20240301.txt,"Central banks usually have an idea of how large they want their balance sheet to be when QT ends; therefore, once the pace of QT is announced, markets should be able to effectively price in the entire program at the announcement of the plan.",0.719503,0.423858
20240301.txt,"After that, the actual execution of QT is simply validating the beliefs that market participants had at the announcement.",0.655788,0.274099
20240301.txt,"This is why many refer to QT as merely draining unneeded reserves, which should be as interesting as watching paint dry.",0.633990,0.245604
20240301.txt,Quantitative Tightening in the United States Let me now turn more directly to the authors' paper and two of their findings.,0.614463,0.219265
20240301.txt,"First, as I mentioned earlier, they find central banks' QT announcements have only a small effect on interest rates.",0.686724,0.347483
20240301.txt,"To conduct this analysis, the authors do an event study around QT announcements, which requires them to identify ""surprises"" in the QT announcements.",0.595636,0.112496
20240301.txt,"As the authors acknowledge, this is not a trivial exercise.",0.635582,0.183833
20240301.txt,My comment here is to point out why identifying a QT announcement surprise is challenging when considering examples in the United States.,0.685233,0.297104
20240301.txt,Let me walk through the evolution of the Fed's QT communications in the spring of 2022 to consider how various communications affected the expected path of QT.,0.673985,0.226094
20240301.txt,7 Recall that QE ended in March 2022.,0.517702,0.035470
20240301.txt,"8 Heading into April, it was likely that markets expected a redemption path somewhat like the Fed's 2017â2019 QT plan.",0.575188,0.659408
20240301.txt,"9 That plan phased in redemptions over 12 months and ultimately allowed, at most, $30 billion of Treasury securities and $20 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to be redeemed each month.",0.574751,0.471043
20240301.txt,"On April 5, 2022, then-Vice Chair Lael Brainard gave a speech that noted the balance sheet would shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous case of QT; specifically, she said that ""significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017â2019.""",0.285875,0.333060
20240301.txt,"10 The next day, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes provided additional information on the expected maximum monthly caps and phase-in period, saying participants generally agreed to a three-month phase-in and caps of $60 billion and $35 billion for Treasury securities and agency MBS, respectively.",0.665828,0.485280
20240301.txt,"Over those two days in April, the markets likely updated their expected QT plans to have sooner and larger redemptions.",0.625505,0.632156
20240301.txt,"This change would be associated with a less negative term premium effect, meaning a rise in Treasury yields.",0.564875,0.743439
20240301.txt,"The 10-year Treasury yield rose 19 basis points over the two days of the Vice Chair's speech and the FOMC minutesâthat is, 12 basis points on the day of her speech and another 7 basis points on the day of the FOMC minutesâand a total of 37 basis points over that week.",0.258065,0.646021
20240301.txt,"About a month later, on May 4, 2022, the FOMC communicated its ""Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.""",0.622340,0.524718
20240301.txt,"The plan was consistent with the FOMC minutes from April, and there was little change in the 10-year Treasury yield that day and week (negative 4 basis points on the day of the announcement and 2 basis points over the five-day period).",0.632080,0.319041
20240301.txt,"So, when doing event studies, it may be difficult to estimate the full impact of QT announcements by simply looking at the formal announcement of the QT plan.",0.633193,0.135638
20240301.txt,"Let me turn to a second point of the paper, about which types of investors have increased their securities holdings as the Fed has reduced its holdings.",0.573541,0.449877
20240301.txt,"When a central bank steps away from asset purchases and begins to shrink its balance sheet, a common question is, who will step in and take the central bank's place in buying securities?",0.537730,0.122603

20240301.txt,This would then affect how fast the central bank can reduce its balance sheet and whether it can do so passively or actively.,0.529731,0.290782
20240301.txt,One could also argue that it matters because knowing the buyers helps one understand the transmission of QT to asset prices and interest rates.,0.660610,0.397910
20240301.txt,Does it matter if it is banks or nonbank financial firms that are doing the buying?,0.544097,0.049648

20240301.txt,One needs to have a better understanding of why the question is being asked before one can fully understand the answers to the question.,0.656385,0.309761
20240301.txt,The authors focus on the reduction in aggregate securities holdings of central banks and find that households and broker-dealers are the main investors absorbing the redeemed securities.,0.425951,0.366294
20240301.txt,"For my discussion today, I decided to dig a bit deeper into the Financial Accounts of the United States in two ways.",0.594710,0.286142
20240301.txt,"First, I decided to look at each type of security (Treasury securities and agency MBS) individually.",0.612229,0.174933

20240301.txt,"For agency MBS, not only has the market shares of those two investor types increased, but so has the market shares of money market funds.",0.296575,0.634078
20240301.txt,"Second, I dug into the household category a bit more.",0.576336,0.353334
20240301.txt,"As currently categorized, the Financial Accounts household category includes hedge funds.",0.545388,0.060118
20240301.txt,The Federal Reserve Board is working to segregate hedge funds in this data set.,0.644014,0.259652
20240301.txt,"In the interim, the Board publishes separate data on the balance sheets of domestic hedge funds.",0.603782,0.053511

20240301.txt,This means the increase is driven by the other household investors: actual households and nonprofit organizations.,0.610647,0.344711
20240301.txt,What do I make of this finding?,0.537831,0.069039
20240301.txt,"My interpretation is that it reinforces the view that the demand for U.S. Treasury securities is broad and deepâthe buyers are not a narrow set of deep-pocketed, sophisticated investors but rather the American public.",0.671674,0.337081
20240301.txt,"As a result, the pace of runoff is not a problem.",0.725066,0.404537
20240301.txt,"As we have seen with the current phase of QT, runoff up to $95 billion a month is not causing substantial strains in financial marketsâsomething that a few years ago would have surprised a lot of people, given the worries about QT that were common prior to 2022.",0.574916,0.548341
20240301.txt,Normalization Let me conclude with a few comments on where I believe the Fed should be heading as it continues to normalize its balance sheet.,0.693259,0.398659

20240301.txt,"The SRF serves as a backstop in money markets, since it takes in Treasury securities as well as agency MBS and puts reserves in the banking system.",0.629057,0.282887

20240301.txt,This approach could also assist a future asset purchase program because we could let the short-term securities roll off the portfolio and not increase the balance sheet.,0.617176,0.615314

20240327.txt,So let me posit several factors that have been suggested for explaining the recent increase in productivity and try to place them in the one-off or long-run buckets.,0.629916,0.331922
20240327.txt,"Many people point to recent large investment projects in the United States, such as those associated with the Inflation Reduction Act or artificial intelligence, as boosting productivity.",0.275156,0.660865
20240327.txt,But these investments will take place over many years and may not have done much yet to add to the nation's productive capacity.,0.628406,0.499467

20240327.txt,"Thus, they are unlikely to explain the recent rise in productivity growth.",0.633275,0.547082
20240327.txt,The recent surge in business start-ups after a sustained lull has also been mentioned as a factor.,0.388170,0.641144
20240327.txt,"Like the investment projects, it may be causing a boost to productivity, but it is likely to occur over a number of years.",0.359758,0.757477
20240327.txt,"And, unless the current boom in new business formation continues into the future, once again this factor will at best raise the level of productivity over the short term and not the long-run growth rate.",0.507224,0.765294
20240327.txt,Another factor that is often pointed to is the resolution of supply chain problems.,0.675088,0.379147
20240327.txt,"But once the supply chain issues are resolved, this boost to productivity growth will end, so this clearly is a short-run factor that will simply raise the level but not the long-run growth rate of productivity.",0.667446,0.609659
20240327.txt,Another potential cause of recent productivity growth is that the pandemic changed how we work and use technology.,0.569219,0.493316
20240327.txt,"While I certainly can see how this could affect the level of productivity and short-run growth, once we have made those changes, they're done, so I don't see this as a driver of sustained productivity growth.",0.722026,0.534338

20240403.txt,The Federal Reserve cannot entirely eliminate discount window borrowing stigma through regulatory fiat.,0.686701,0.356514
20240403.txt,One of the key sources of stigma seems to be the spectrum of reasons that a bank may choose to borrow from the discount window: the need for borrowing could be due to market disruptions in the provision of liquidity or a scarcity in the total amount of reserves in the banking system but could also indicate a specific borrower's growing financial stress.,0.614129,0.299990
20240403.txt,"Of course, it is possible that a combination of factors may lead a bank to access the discount windowâas stress on banking institutions builds, there may be a ""pullback"" on the ordinary liquidity tools banks use, accompanied by increased demands for liquidity.",0.406324,0.431833
20240403.txt,"In this context, discount window lending becomes one additional data point for the market to interpretâwhile the signal it may send is unclear, one can easily imagine that the market may be skittish and fixate on any sign of financial weakness.",0.472047,0.285811

20240404.txt,"Let me start with a little personal background, since that helped form my approach to research.",0.580859,0.171751
20240404.txt,I was born in the U.S. but grew up in Colombia.,0.528337,0.109030

20240404.txt,"Later, as an undergraduate, I found that economics offered tools that could help society understand and, I hoped, address some of these problems.",0.585144,0.459660
20240404.txt,"What I started to see, and then saw more over time, was that in many ways the different social problems I observed were closely related to the opportunities people have to work and earn an income that reflects their effort and productivity as workersâin short, issues at the heart of labor economics.",0.629227,0.302273
20240404.txt,"It also turned out that the tools of economicsâfor example, math and statistical analysisâwere well suited to studying these questions and helped ground my work in objective reality.",0.556743,0.407334
20240404.txt,So I developed these skills by pursuing a Ph.D. in economics.,0.541849,0.328532

20240404.txt,It mattered to me as a member of the community with my own children attending those schools.,0.562998,0.256257

20240404.txt,Classmates in the same classes with similar backgrounds could have similar outcomes for lots of reasons.,0.526089,0.271021

20240404.txt,"Using traditional methods in economics, we conducted a number of what economists call ""robustness checks,"" making sure that our assumption that the relocating families weren't picking school districts based on pre-existing trends held up, trying different ways of measuring outcomes or specifying models, and attempting to exclude alternative explanations, such as changes in teacher quality or educational resources.",0.671423,0.310828
20240404.txt,"Using these familiar methods, we had found that Houston schools were able to absorb the new students with little aggregate effect on local students.",0.494355,0.594041
20240404.txt,But that finding sent us back to think about the theories we had developed at the start of the project and the different reasons that make peers relevant to a student.,0.600619,0.265569

20240404.txt,"But these papers didn't allow me to explore the separate contribution of the stipend to the wage, employment, and educational gains we found.",0.643085,0.327598

The 1960s to the 1980s In the 1960s, during the heyday of Keynesian macroeconomics, researchers widely believed that monetary policymakers faced a long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and that the tradeoff could be calibrated to keep unemployment indefinitely low at an acceptable cost in terms of higher inflation.",0.600850,0.551670

20240416.txt,3 A parallel strand of research that embraced at least part of the message of Friedman was also under way.,0.570344,0.385811

20240418.txt,"The Banking Landscape and Risks Today Over the past few years, we have experienced a number of challenges around the world and in the U.S. that have reverberated throughout the economy and have required banks to confront and mitigate the associated risksâincluding the pandemic, a sharp rise in inflation with an associated rapid rise in interest rates, CRE market uncertainties due to changing work and business preferences, increased third-party fintech engagement in the banking industry, and the 2023 bank failures.",0.472991,0.553421

20240418.txt,"Bankers and regulators alike must consider how our reactions to these issues will impact the future of the banking system, and how safety and soundness, consumer protection, U.S. financial stability, and the ongoing and future role of banks within the U.S. financial system will be affected.",0.698869,0.312880
20240418.txt,"Banks must ensure their risk-management frameworks appropriately identify, measure, monitor, and control for both existing and emerging risks.",0.683681,0.439582
20240418.txt,They must continue to innovate responsibly and ensure their risk-management frameworks account for novel product offerings both prior to implementation and as the service and customer engagement evolves.,0.573519,0.617698
20240418.txt,Regulators must consider the many tradeoffs in their approach to supervision and regulation to most effectively support banks as they embark upon and continue on this journey.,0.717300,0.491562
20240418.txt,"In their quest to be agile by offering new services and responding to new and evolving risks, banks must have access to and understand the rules of the road.",0.646488,0.468477

20240418.txt,"Risk Management and Contingency Funding Shifting to contingency funding plans, given the expanding number of challenges and shocks that the economy has faced over the past few years, it is prudent for banks not only to continue to evolve and update emergency planning activities in light of these risks, but also to test their emergency plans.",0.711475,0.596664
20240418.txt,"Since the banking stress and bank failures last spring, these risks have led to heightened liquidity risks for some firms.",0.355195,0.537515
20240418.txt,I understand that supervisors at the New York Fed and across the Federal Reserve System have engaged with state member banks and holding companies about appropriate risk management and have indicated that those plans should include emergency borrowing from the discount window if a bank's condition warrants a need for emergency liquidity.,0.705539,0.581679
20240418.txt,"Last year, the Federal Reserve Board issued updated guidance noting that depository institutions should regularly evaluate and update their contingency funding plans.",0.749316,0.608224

20240418.txt,"However, as I've noted previously, while it may be appropriate for supervisors to encourage banks to establish and maintain contingency funding sources, test the contingency funding plans, and evaluate whether those plans are adequate in the context of examination, supervisors are not bankers.",0.729395,0.349441
20240418.txt,And we must be cautious not to cross the line from supervisor to member of the management team and avoid interfering with the decisionmaking of bank management.,0.709778,0.287249
20240418.txt,"We must also ensure that liquidity requirements and supervisory expectations are commensurate with the bank's size, complexity, and risk profile.",0.732763,0.496854
20240418.txt,Supervisory Changes Regulators have an important role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking system in light of evolving risks.,0.670997,0.424530
20240418.txt,"These risks can be exacerbated by shortcomings in bank supervision, as we saw last spring.",0.451647,0.376649
20240418.txt,"These bank failures and the events and circumstances surrounding them warrant review, self-reflection, and where necessary, appropriately targeted changes to identified gaps in regulation and supervision.",0.707695,0.424830
20240418.txt,We should carefully examine what is working and what can be improved in bank supervision.,0.664557,0.514566
20240418.txt,"In doing so, we must appropriately and effectively manage our supervisory programs, teams, and expectations to ensure that efficient, effective, and consistent supervision is implemented across our regulated entities according to a bank's complexity, size, risk profile, and scope of activities.",0.705547,0.459919
20240418.txt,Conducting supervision in a manner that respects due process and provides transparency around supervisory expectations goes a long way in accomplishing these goals.,0.606402,0.499009
20240418.txt,"We should acknowledge that changes to supervisory expectations and processes, coupled with the sheer volume of recent regulatory and supervisory reforms and proposed reforms, will undoubtedly present additional challenges and risks for banks.",0.531156,0.541810
20240418.txt,"While some changes to the supervisory process and priorities may be appropriate to promote a safe and sound financial system and enhance financial stability, having an appropriate focus on the most salient risks is important for effective risk management and effective supervision.",0.689496,0.587419
20240418.txt,We should be cautious that these changes do not distract banks or supervisors from focusing on core and emerging risks or impair the long-term viability of the banking systemâespecially for mid-sized and smaller banks.,0.688702,0.448646
20240418.txt,"In closing, I hope that today's conference provides an opportunity for open and frank conversations about prudent risk management and how we can work together to maintain a safe and sound financial system.",0.495507,0.619989

At the Texas Bankers Association 2024 Annual Meeting, Arlington, Texas

I would like to thank the Texas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my thoughts with you at this year's Annual Meeting.",0.504929,0.293241
20240510.txt,1 My remarks today focus on financial stability and the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability and resiliency in the financial system.,0.632514,0.368502
20240510.txt,2 I will also describe principles that are complementary to promoting safety and soundnessâto help inform the regulatory and supervisory agenda.,0.622653,0.379761
20240510.txt,"Of course, it would be difficult to provide an exhaustive list of the financial stability risks facing the financial system in the time we are together today.",0.704868,0.247702
20240510.txt,"So, while I will highlight a few key risks, one must approach this topic with humility, acknowledging that there are limits to a regulator's ability to anticipate every possible financial stability risk in a dynamic and increasingly interconnected world.",0.747112,0.521428
20240510.txt,Financial stability is an important function of the Federal Reserve.,0.675309,0.276989
20240510.txt,"Our financial stability function is supported through appropriate monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and by monitoring risks in the U.S. and abroad.",0.667620,0.474285
20240510.txt,A stable financial system provides a solid foundation for a healthy banking system and a growing economy that facilitates maximum employment and stable prices.,0.464602,0.665535
20240510.txt,The Fed's recently published Financial Stability Report discusses financial stability risks in terms of interactions between shocks and vulnerabilities.,0.688439,0.356297
20240510.txt,A financial stability shock is an adverse event or series of events that often occur without warning and severely affect the financial system.,0.341279,0.015781
20240510.txt,"A financial stability vulnerability includes a specific characteristic of, or activity conducted in, the financial system that can increase the severity of a stress event when a shock occurs.",0.553402,0.224304
20240510.txt,"3 Since shocks are difficult to predict, the Federal Reserve's monitoring efforts primarily focus on vulnerabilities and the buildup of risks that can accrue over time potentially affecting the resiliency of the financial system.",0.675821,0.363426

20240510.txt,It is important to keep in mind that the report provides only a snapshot of the current financial stability vulnerabilities and risks.,0.702665,0.235645
20240510.txt,"Because the report treats cyberattacks and geopolitical events as shocks, it touches on them only in a cursory way, even though these are important financial stability risks.",0.692309,0.283861
20240510.txt,"Instead, the report focuses on key vulnerabilities that are more easily monitored and provides insights into the financial stability outlook as it relates to these factors.",0.632608,0.441859

20240510.txt,"Often the boundary between shocks and vulnerabilities is a permeable one, and the buildup of risk can become so severe that it becomes a shock.",0.514192,0.159712
20240510.txt,The Federal Reserve plays an importantâbut limited and non-exclusiveârole in proactively addressing financial stability risks and responding to them once they manifest as stress across the system.,0.713971,0.508267
20240510.txt,As I think about the tools we use to address financial stability concernsâand the tradeoffs we are often forced to make when exercising these powersâit is helpful to consider the lessons regulators have learned over time.,0.678902,0.403563
20240510.txt,While the end goal is the sameâensuring resiliency in the financial system to promote financial stabilityâthere are a number of tools that can be used to address the unique characteristics of vulnerabilities and shocks.,0.604952,0.352108
20240510.txt,The Federal Reserve's financial stability monitoring does not operate in a vacuum.,0.720230,0.248931
20240510.txt,"To the contrary, our other statutory authoritiesâincluding monetary policy or promoting safety and soundness in the banking systemâcan complement or conflict with the goal of promoting financial stability.",0.617838,0.285675
20240510.txt,Many of these authorities interact with banking activities and institutions that are subject to our supervisory or regulatory authority.,0.620852,0.126037

20240510.txt,"I will then describe the limits of these tools, and then conclude with a brief discussion of some other key financial stability risks.",0.672687,0.280132

20240510.txt,"At times, these objectives may appear to present tension or be in conflict.",0.604104,0.305495
20240510.txt,"For example, the banking stress last year resulted from a number of underlying causes.",0.543783,0.207443
20240510.txt,But it is clear that trends in the interest rate environment when the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) was rapidly tightening policy to combat inflation were an important factor that contributed to Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB's) failure.,0.563583,0.416194
20240510.txt,The Federal Reserve's documented supervisory shortcomings and the lack of SVB management attention to these risks were also key contributors to the firm's failure.,0.364460,0.282444
20240510.txt,"To be sure, the role of monetary policy in the demise of SVB does not excuse SVB's management from its inability to manage the firm's interest rate risk exposures or excuse the ineffective supervisory response that enabled the buildup of the firm's excessive risk.",0.370451,0.239277
20240510.txt,"And I am not calling into question the FOMC's monetary policy decisions from that time, which were appropriately focused on our congressionally established mandates of maximum employment and stable prices.",0.755129,0.529885
20240510.txt,"Instead, these issues highlight the challenging interrelationships of the various roles and functions of the Federal Reserve.",0.621918,0.288952
20240510.txt,This becomes more complicated when we consider the Federal Reserve's financial stability objectives in the context of its prudential mandates to promote the safe and sound operation of regulated financial institutions.,0.730149,0.443911
20240510.txt,"The tools of bank regulation and supervision can promote the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but they can also be a positive force when it comes to financial stability.",0.593412,0.528393
20240510.txt,When regulators are successful in their task of ensuring the safe and sound operation of the banking systemâone of the core mandates for banking regulatorsâoften there is a corresponding benefit to financial stability.,0.627465,0.536098
20240510.txt,"Put another way, if the individual parts of the banking system are healthy, this often promotes the health and stability of the broader financial system.",0.678521,0.502358
20240510.txt,But the goal of promoting bank safety and soundness is narrowly focused within the regulatory perimeterâand the institutions and activities within our regulatory and supervisory authority.,0.678110,0.295389
20240510.txt,"By contrast, financial stability must be concerned with the broader financial system, including the multitude of nonbank institutions that play an important role not only in delivering financial products and services, but also in the broader U.S. economy.",0.671353,0.319488
20240510.txt,"So today, I'd like to share three principles that can help frame a discussion of the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability:

There is value in our current approach to addressing financial stability risks.",0.605974,0.456195
20240510.txt,We monitor risks and how they build up or manifest as stress in the financial system.,0.704034,0.302725
20240510.txt,"And we react in a way that is informed by that monitoring, either to proactively address the buildup of risk, or to address the consequences of events that could threaten financial stability.",0.739470,0.428337
20240510.txt,A review of past events that presented stability concerns can help us evaluate our existing work and inform the direction of future investments.,0.638404,0.413962
20240510.txt,"Effective Bank Supervision to Promote Financial Stability First, bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability.",0.583316,0.464743
20240510.txt,I think it is helpful to consider commercial real estate (CRE) as an example.,0.636102,0.304120
20240510.txt,4 Commercial real estate continues to be an area of focus for both banks and regulators.,0.604094,0.371822
20240510.txt,"Some banks have experienced an increase in CRE loan delinquencies, although delinquency rates generally remain low.",0.366399,0.707245
20240510.txt,"As we know, one of the factors that has led to CRE stress in certain property types, like office, is the post-pandemic changes in the demand for, and use of, these CRE properties.",0.629168,0.400954
20240510.txt,"Should this trend continue, we could see declines in property values, reduced rental income cash flows, or other conditions that could lead to impairment of some banks' CRE loans or portfolios, especially if those loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates.",0.312396,0.227628
20240510.txt,I expect we will continue to see material differences in the performance of CRE across the various types of commercial property and in specific geographic regions.,0.633777,0.615390
20240510.txt,"This will be due, in part, to variations in regional return-to-office patterns, and the shifting demand for different types of CRE properties.",0.639059,0.465979
20240510.txt,"So, what can we learn from this CRE experience?",0.541311,0.281495
20240510.txt,"First, supervision can be an effective tool to mitigate vulnerabilities, like the increasing credit risk associated with certain kinds of lending.",0.583914,0.574519
20240510.txt,"Underwriting standards and loan-to-value ratios have improved significantly since the 2008â09 financial crisis, and more recently we have seen credit conditions for CRE lending tighten, even as loan demand weakened.",0.221220,0.753075
20240510.txt,"I see this as reflecting both better management of these loans and portfolios, and more proactive supervision of material risk.",0.545007,0.642844
20240510.txt,"5 Banks are also well-equipped to work with their CRE borrowers to mitigate stress, including through loan accommodations and workouts.",0.414104,0.664085
20240510.txt,"6 Supervision can be particularly effective at addressing well-known, core banking risks, especially when this supervisory work is conducted effectively and without being distracted by non-core risks.",0.571238,0.515935
20240510.txt,"Despite the promise of supervision as a tool to promote financial stability, supervision can sometimes fail to address the significant buildup of traditional risk.",0.590811,0.349621
20240510.txt,And supervision can be susceptible to being diverted from core risks to issues of less material concern.,0.677732,0.290561
20240510.txt,"For example, take the dynamics that led to the failure of SVB.",0.525521,0.078546
20240510.txt,"The buildup of interest rate risk in the banking system was a known vulnerability and material risk, not just for SVB, but for all financial institutions.",0.518502,0.264363
20240510.txt,"The responsibility for managing this risk fell on the management team at SVB, just as it falls on every bank that has material exposure to interest rate risk.",0.536038,0.063079
20240510.txt,"And yet, the failure of SVB created something of a ""shock"" event within the banking system, one that led to a vigorous response with the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program and invoking the systemic risk exemption to guarantee all depositors of SVB and Signature Bank.",0.514459,0.576463
20240510.txt,I think it is an oversimplification to point to any one factor as the root cause of the failure of SVB.,0.547942,0.107793
20240510.txt,There were a number of issues that contributed to the firm's ultimate failure.,0.448730,0.139392
20240510.txt,"These events included rapid growth, poor risk management, poor public communication, a lack of supervisory attention to core risks, and an insufficiently robust supervisory response to the buildup of interest rate and funding risk.",0.214647,0.033278
20240510.txt,These issues were exacerbated by operational and technological problems with FedWire and discount window lending.,0.149065,0.125133
20240510.txt,The cumulative effect of these issues likely accelerated the firm's failure and increased the scope of the resulting financial harm.,0.365004,0.423968
20240510.txt,"But certainly, this is a clear example of where the Federal Reserve's proactive toolsâsupervision of risk management, and the operation of liquidity support and payment toolsâcould have been much more effective.",0.652838,0.549411
20240510.txt,"Therefore, the virtue of supervision as a proactive measure to support financial stability comes with a cautionary note.",0.654135,0.588890
20240510.txt,Ineffective supervision itself can compound financial stability risks by allowing the buildup of risk without commensurate risk-management measures or supervisory attention.,0.587697,0.332229
20240510.txt,One protective measure that we can take to support effective supervision is to ensure that focus on traditional risks is not lost or diluted.,0.641493,0.527697
20240510.txt,One example of a supervisory and regulatory distraction is from the Fed's recent focus on climate risk.,0.396888,0.277089
20240510.txt,"Recently, the Federal Reserve conducted a pilot climate scenario exercise with a subset of the largest U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and issued guidance to large institutions on managing climate-related financial risk.",0.586923,0.567042
20240510.txt,"This regulatory attention and focus on one specific, non-core risk could reasonably call into question whether regulatory priorities are focused sufficiently on key risks.",0.713761,0.468030

20240514.txt,CDFIs are a critical source of financing for organizations working on the front lines of community development.,0.577065,0.366098
20240514.txt,"They reach households, individuals, businesses, and civic organizations that might otherwise be underservedâas compared with the level of attention, favorable terms, and assistance offered by CDFIsâor even unserved by traditional financial institutions.",0.601180,0.486823

20240514.txt,These institutions also provide other important services that complement their loan offerings.,0.558847,0.388646
20240514.txt,"For example, they often require clients to participate in assistance programming, such as credit counseling, homeownership counseling, or business coaching, before receiving loans.",0.562793,0.100688

20240514.txt,They leverage their relationships to help their borrowers grow and thrive.,0.511080,0.485557

20240514.txt,"2 For example, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas indicates that mission-driven financial institutions, including CDFIs, provided more Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to borrowers in low- and moderate-income communities and majority-minority communities than their traditional counterparts.",0.393089,0.638314

Interest in CDFI products and services also continues to grow.",0.299205,0.616279

20240514.txt,5 CDFIs are especially adept at leveraging capitalâwith some programs leveraging $8 in private-sector investment for every $1 of public funding.,0.583416,0.339461
20240514.txt,6 That leverage helps meet this growing demand.,0.377450,0.637390

20240514.txt,"Therefore, building out long-term sources of capital is a continuing challenge.",0.617612,0.428553

20240514.txt,New research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that CDFIs sell billions of dollars of loans each year but tend not to do so systematically.,0.611331,0.238185
20240514.txt,"Also, residential mortgage loans account for almost all the volume sold by CDFIs.",0.529570,0.112751

20240514.txt,"7 Later in today's program, you will hear more about opportunities for CDFIs to explore options, such as pooling and securitizing loans to expand their access to capital markets as well as further developing the secondary market for loans backed by other collateral types aside from residential mortgages.",0.454923,0.498083
20240514.txt,"Second, the increasing cost of lending capital makes extending affordable credit to their low- and moderate-income borrowers more difficult.",0.447851,0.360232

20240517.txt,Let's start with some early examples from U.S. payments history.,0.585194,0.162496
20240517.txt,"The free-banking era from 1837 to 1863 experienced significant fragmentation and corresponding frictions in the payment system as competing banknotes circulated across different geographical regions, requiring costly and inefficient trading of various forms of currency and featuring high levels of fraud and counterfeiting.",0.284588,0.112866
20240517.txt,"2 Later, during the national banking era from 1863 to 1913, checks were becoming a predominant form of payment at the same time that the population of the United States was moving westward, requiring a nationwide method to clear checks.",0.598422,0.239389
20240517.txt,"The check clearing infrastructure at the time, however, was regional, creating a patchwork network reliant on correspondent banks to move and clear checks across regions, often at high cost and with long delays.",0.599102,0.278704
20240517.txt,"Congress created the Federal Reserve in 1913 and assigned the Fed a number of key roles including issuance of Federal Reserve Notes and, in short order, establishment of a national check-clearing network.",0.589225,0.355972
20240517.txt,These are examples that predate electronic payments where standardization improved the efficiency of payments.,0.585406,0.388238

20240517.txt,"Immediately after 9/11, planes were grounded, and check payments, which were still largely paper-based, could not be processed.",0.272609,0.013548
20240517.txt,3 This highlighted inefficiency in the clearing of paper checks.,0.242609,0.093168
20240517.txt,"In response, Congress passed the Check 21 Act, which enabled banks to process check information electronically using digital images of an original check.",0.528776,0.364193

20240517.txt,This process establishes standards that are seen as credible and legitimate.,0.634093,0.374139
20240517.txt,Considerations and Lessons Learned It is important to note that simply having a standard in place will not automatically translate to economic benefits.,0.689289,0.528666
20240517.txt,"To achieve network effects, standards must be widely adopted.",0.680894,0.431350
20240517.txt,"Developing consensus-based standards implies that all relevant participants are at the table and advocating for their interests, which is not a given, but is critical if standards are to be widely adopted.",0.657388,0.444418
20240517.txt,Timing is also important.,0.709328,0.306136
20240517.txt,"In the early stages of technological advances, standards should not be overly prescriptive to stifle innovation and should be flexible and adaptable as the market changes.",0.711230,0.502748

20240517.txt,"Nonetheless, there has been variation in ISO 20022 implementation, and further industry coordination over time will be necessary to align on common practices.",0.659303,0.554830
20240517.txt,"All of thisâidentifying the need and timing for standards, incorporating a breadth of industry perspectives, and aligning on implementation approachesârequires an immense amount of coordination.",0.581279,0.441886
20240517.txt,And much of this coordination must take place among competitors.,0.627612,0.330942
20240517.txt,So often a neutral convener is needed to achieve better outcomes.,0.694545,0.441118
20240517.txt,"That is why we have standard development organizations like ISO to provide a forum where participants from the private sector, academia, and the public sector can contribute expertise and collectively shape standards in a way that meets business and public sector objectives, providing some comfort that the needs of all market participants and consumers will be considered.",0.599585,0.424864
20240517.txt,The Federal Reserve and Payments Technical Standards That brings me to the Federal Reserve's roles in this processânot role but roles .,0.623928,0.172913

20240517.txt,"For example, in 2015, the Fed issued a call to action in its paper, ""Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System,"" asking stakeholders to come together in pursuit of a better payment system for the future.",0.529598,0.585661
20240517.txt,"The paper, and subsequent work, highlighted the role of standards to enhance payments security and efficiency at various points in the payment and ancillary processing flows, noting the importance of supporting industry efforts to develop and adopt standards, as well as common approaches to implementation.",0.527792,0.598800
20240517.txt,"6

The Federal Reserve itself adopts standards in its role as a payment system operator.",0.652623,0.286750

20240517.txt,We expect this adoption will improve the speed of wholesale cross-border payments by reducing operational costs and promoting consistent communication across global platforms.,0.314675,0.688891
20240517.txt,The richer data in ISO 20022 could also improve anti-money laundering and sanctions screening and support broader adoption of extended remittance information.,0.386214,0.631934
20240517.txt,"In serving as a neutral convenor, providing payments expertise, and improving payments in our role as a payment system operator, the Fed extends its long history of engaging in the development of payments technical standards.",0.512411,0.595790

20240524.txt,"So, what drove the decline of the real return on government debt?",0.418522,0.192087
20240524.txt,It is obvious that what makes U.S. government debt different from the real return on capital and other interest rates is its safety and global liquidity.,0.656882,0.407940

20240614.txt,"First, two key features of the AEASP team and program at MSU were humility and agility.",0.627854,0.399559
20240614.txt,"As many of the former directors here know well, every program is a startup when it moves from one university to another.",0.610318,0.135487
20240614.txt,"While we started with a detailed plan for all five years, we did not know how everything would turn out and had to be open to experimentation and innovation.",0.674202,0.295775
20240614.txt,"After the first year, it became obvious that the program needed a systematic advising component.",0.681848,0.348154
20240614.txt,"Armed with this intensive training in economics, the students still needed help planning next steps back at their home institutions and for the future.",0.574878,0.505020
20240614.txt,"The second year, we instituted a mandatory advising session with a faculty administrator on the last day of the program.",0.619717,0.167625
20240614.txt,"The students completed a survey with their educational objectives for the next two to three years, and we commented on them.",0.635442,0.368642
20240614.txt,This became a critical and ongoing souvenir of the program.,0.606168,0.299081
20240614.txt,It has been heartwarming to see program alumni stick to these plans and execute them many years after leaving the AEASP.,0.548256,0.461498
20240614.txt,"During the second year, we also realized how important machine learning was becoming to conducting research and to preparing for graduate study in economics.",0.560124,0.428208

20240614.txt,"In addition to traditional outreach methods, we engaged social media, including going to where economists wereâEconTwitterâto introduce economics departments and interested students to the new program at MSU, to provide general information, and to give updates on students, program activities, and alumni.",0.590939,0.254283
20240614.txt,"There were several memorable social media events: Two live social media sessions on different platforms, the Instagram photo contest, and the ""Selfies with Sue"" [Dynarski] sessions during our excursion to Detroit and Ann Arbor.",0.519528,0.250953

20240614.txt,"Students spontaneously became peer mentors to each other, using time they could have used to do their own problem sets or study for their own exams to mentor a student struggling in a course or grappling with misgivings about the path to a PhD instead.",0.522882,0.198439
20240614.txt,Fellows (TAs) came from all over the country and from a variety of economics programs to support the AEASP students and each other as participants in the dissertation brown bag seminar.,0.553517,0.302594

20240618.txt,"I was encouraged by some of the details of the recent reports, particularly the continued improvement in market-based services inflation, which is based on observation of actual market prices rather than imputed values.",0.578250,0.653548
20240618.txt,That's important because market-based prices are likely to be a better indication of the overall trend for core services inflation than nonmarket prices.,0.641590,0.687791

20240618.txt,"However, there are several reasons why I remain optimistic that improving supply and cooling demand will support continued disinflation.",0.556018,0.714803
20240618.txt,The first reason I am optimistic about further progress on inflation has to do with declining price increases and even declining prices as consumers become more price sensitive.,0.634244,0.610078
20240618.txt,"I think of this from several, related anglesâI will mention a few.",0.573809,0.154732
20240618.txt,"As I have discussed in previous speeches, reduced frequency of price adjustments helps moderate prices.",0.590847,0.765302

20240618.txt,"2 Price adjustment frequency picked up some early this year, along with the temporary firming of inflation, but the general trend has been consistent with ongoing disinflation.",0.371353,0.708815
20240618.txt,An additional basis for price-setting optimism is the fact that longer-run inflation expectations have remained well anchored.,0.491148,0.809022
20240618.txt,"Research by the Richmond Fed has found that price-setting decisions by firms are related to their own expectations about the path of overall inflation, so anchored inflation expectations among firms are likely to result in price setting consistent with those lower price expectations.",0.641180,0.633974
20240618.txt,"3

In addition, there may still be room for markups of prices over labor costs to continue falling.",0.426649,0.579036
20240618.txt,"While markups are famously difficult to measure, rough, simple estimates of markups of prices over labor costs have fallen back from high levels but still remain above their pre-pandemic trend, especially in the goods sector.",0.336767,0.316158
20240618.txt,4 A return of markups to this trend could help ongoing progress toward 2 percent inflation.,0.362258,0.751762
20240618.txt,A final factor for optimism about positive price-setting developments is the range of anecdotes from firms themselves.,0.576017,0.428822
20240618.txt,The most recent edition of the Fed's Beige Book suggests firms are increasingly attentive to consumers pushing back against additional price increases and that these businesses expect to increase prices only moderately in the near term.,0.548313,0.825201
20240618.txt,"Beyond the Beige Book, I have gleaned from recent earnings reports by publicly traded companies that lower-income consumers are pulling back from their purchasing and that firms are responding by moderating price increases or, in some cases, actually cutting prices.",0.436750,0.447495
20240618.txt,"What I have heard in my own conversations with business contacts is that consumers are ""trading down"" to lower-cost products and that firms are responding with more discounting.",0.587754,0.431357
20240618.txt,And some large retailers have publicly spoken about cutting prices in the face of resistant consumers.,0.331685,0.460108
20240618.txt,"These various indicatorsâmarkups, price adjustment frequency, inflation expectations, and anecdotes from a range of sourcesâsuggest that, on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency with the FOMC's inflation target.",0.742362,0.664397
20240618.txt,A second reason for my optimism about continued disinflation is slower growth in the costs faced by businesses.,0.528611,0.519440
20240618.txt,"Among those, nominal wages are a big part of total costs in the services sector.",0.518534,0.164695
20240618.txt,"Nominal wage growth has continued to trend down, consistent with a labor market where supply and demand are coming into better balance.",0.320490,0.352119
20240618.txt,"Of course, as a general matter, I want to see Americans experiencing strong wage growth, but for that wage growth to be sustainable, it must be consistent with our inflation target.",0.677917,0.740521
20240618.txt,"Notably, as inflation has come down, real wages have been rising and now exceed pre-pandemic levels, which means that the purchasing power of workers has also been increasing.",0.391856,0.712871
20240618.txt,"But at the same time, we have seen slowing growth in nominal labor costs.",0.298936,0.423387

20240618.txt,"Another indicator of labor market tightness, the ratio of job vacancies to the number of people counted as looking for work, crossed an important threshold in April.",0.359732,0.434437

20240618.txt,"A third reason for my optimism about achieving 2 percent inflation is that I am also cautiously optimistic about productivity growth, which is a source of supply expansion that is likely to put downward pressure on inflation without slower economic growth.",0.669969,0.686756
20240618.txt,"One factor is the remarkable rise in the rate of new business creation, which started early in the pandemic and has continued, more or less, even through last month.",0.332841,0.683476

20240618.txt,8 I suspect that most of the productivity benefits of the recent entry surge are still ahead of us.,0.386317,0.665685
20240618.txt,Another basis for productivity optimism is the prospect for widespread implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms.,0.438365,0.669367

20240618.txt,The spread of electrification more than a century ago required complementary assets like power lines and appliances to be created and installed.,0.499039,0.287383
20240618.txt,"But I suspect that AI may diffuse more quickly, in part because many of the complementary assets needed for the initial spread of AIâsuch as computers, networks, and the likeâare already in place, even while there is still an enormous amount of additional hardware buildout still ahead of us.",0.558149,0.529653

20240618.txt,"9 Only time will tell, of course, but the prospect of higher productivity growth raises the possibility that inflation can fall without a significant slowdown in economic activity and employment.",0.420094,0.589601
20240618.txt,My fourth and final reason for optimism on inflation is that I believe the current stance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to help cool the economy and bring inflation back toward 2 percent without a sharp contraction in economic activity or a significant deterioration of the labor market.,0.612972,0.804318
20240618.txt,"Interest rates remain elevated relative to a year ago, and certainly relative to two or three years ago, and are restricting economic activity.",0.302645,0.218784

Third, DCCA ensures that financial institutions under the Fed's jurisdiction comply with laws and regulations that protect consumers and promote community development, including fair lending laws and the prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices.",0.647084,0.371299

20240709.txt,The U.S. banking system is well-positioned to bring consumers into the financial mainstream by providing innovative solutions to meet the credit needs of their communities.,0.465836,0.577336
20240709.txt,"For example, banks help consumers and small businesses by providing financial products and services that are safe, fair, and responsive, including through small dollar loan products.",0.589772,0.397770

20240709.txt,"Data from the most recent SHED report found that 10 percent of adults with family incomes less than $50,000 per year used payday, pawn, auto title, or tax refund anticipation loans to obtain needed funds.",0.466664,0.265292
20240709.txt,5 These types of products often carry high or even punitive direct and indirect costs and risks to the consumer.,0.546503,0.280548
20240709.txt,"For example, non-repayment of an auto title loan can lead to vehicle repossession further complicating the consumer's financial situation.",0.210882,0.080834

20240709.txt,"6

Some banks that offer small dollar loan products often use automated underwriting based on alternative information that can include consumer-permissioned cash-flow data.",0.559673,0.158697
20240709.txt,"If used appropriately, this approach can reduce bank underwriting costs, potentially making affordably priced loans available to consumers on a more timely basis.",0.445819,0.730962

20240709.txt,"Remittances and Financial Inclusion As we heard from our panelists earlier today, payments inclusion can look different in domestic and international contexts, but a reliable, safe, and cost-efficient payment system that minimizes unintended frictions is important to consumers around the world.",0.642111,0.558314
20240709.txt,"International remittances can serve an important role in enhancing financial inclusion, especially in countries where these funds are a significant source of household financial support.",0.503274,0.612313

However, for those who send funds abroad using remittances, the costs can be substantial.",0.513318,0.319742
20240709.txt,"For example, the average cost of sending $200 internationally from the U.S. is nearly 6 percent.",0.529863,0.287876

20240709.txt,Conclusion Greater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the Federal Reserve.,0.605713,0.669111
20240709.txt,"While we have made great progress, there is more to be done for both the public and private sectors.",0.570211,0.691682
20240709.txt,We should be open to considering how new or innovative products and services could promote financial inclusion.,0.607974,0.442752
20240709.txt,We should also be willing to engage with a wide range of stakeholders.,0.541138,0.554589

20240716.txt,My intent here is to focus on challenges that highlight the tradeoffs in using public and private data and to show how these sources of data complement each other.,0.679290,0.345843
20240716.txt,The first challenge I will identify is that traditional measurement approaches sometimes struggle to track rapidly changing economic developments.,0.627521,0.282420
20240716.txt,This was the case early in the pandemic and is often true at turning points in the business cycle.,0.627758,0.352307

20240716.txt,I will touch on that a bit more later.,0.628156,0.239816
20240716.txt,A second challenge is that many statistical reports were created decades ago and may not be focused on newer or growing sectors of the economy.,0.621647,0.235936
20240716.txt,"For example, there are monthly reports on factory orders, shipments, inventories, and output among the principal economic indicators.",0.616381,0.293472

20240810.txt,"First, as I noted earlier, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due both to increased labor force participation and strong immigration; and lower energy prices.",0.362141,0.750125
20240810.txt,"It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and significantly higher U.S. immigration over the past few years may decrease going forward.",0.355732,0.561195
20240810.txt,"Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, as the recent surge in container shipping costs originating in Asia suggest that global supply chains remain susceptible to disruptions, which could put upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices.",0.264887,0.355065
20240810.txt,"There is also the risk that additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, impeding further progress on reducing inflation.",0.283049,0.278118
20240810.txt,"Finally, there continues to be a risk that the increased immigration could lead to persistently high housing services inflation.",0.337743,0.370091
20240810.txt,"Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize.",0.332998,0.298389
20240810.txt,"There are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have been indicating, but it also appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the degree of cooling in labor markets.",0.366149,0.488802
20240810.txt,"The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report implies that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment survey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become less accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.",0.146316,0.174403
20240810.txt,"2 Moreover, the rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering the labor force are taking longer to find a job, while layoffs remain low.",0.106322,0.164315
20240810.txt,It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report.,0.301352,0.283168
20240810.txt,"The rise in the unemployment rate in July was centered in workers experiencing a temporary layoff, who are more likely to be rehired in coming months, and Hurricane Beryl likely contributed to weaker job gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increased significantly last month.",0.047209,0.205290

20240810.txt,"In particular, equity prices have been volatile recently but are still higher than at the end of last year.",0.373483,0.739061
20240810.txt,I will continue to closely monitor the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I assess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.,0.698268,0.518038
20240810.txt,"As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated.",0.655548,0.717151

20240910.txt,I will recommend that we reduce the calibration for residential real estate exposures so that it is in line with the calibration developed in the Basel process.,0.709028,0.547173

20240910.txt,"The original proposal would have measured the contribution of fee-based activities based on gross revenues, instead of net income, which is revenues minus expenses.",0.643733,0.264874
20240910.txt,"Moving to net income for fee-based activitiesâspecifically, by netting noninterest income and expenses (except for operational losses)âwould produce more consistency in how operational risk is measured across bank activities, as interest and trading income and expenses are already measured on a net basis under the proposal.",0.660283,0.502005
20240910.txt,This change would also produce more consistent operational risk capital requirements across banks because the approach is less sensitive to the differences in accounting practices across banks.,0.633433,0.608317

20240910.txt,It would permit firms to use internal models to capture the complex dynamics of most market risks but would put certain constraints on banks' models and provide fallbacks in areas where modeling practices are not adequate.,0.707471,0.393545

20240926.txt,How much exposure?,0.519579,0.028820
20240926.txt,"First, how exposed is a particular job to AI?",0.569429,0.071065
20240926.txt,It is helpful to think about a job as a set of tasks that the worker must perform.,0.647709,0.174963
20240926.txt,Economist David Autor pioneered this task-based framework for jobs.,0.597456,0.273158
20240926.txt,"He used it to demonstrate that the shift in labor demand, which began in the 1970s, away from jobs that involved a large degree of routine tasks can be explained by these jobs' greater exposure to the rapid adoption of computerization and automation technologies.",0.619143,0.473081
20240926.txt,4 We can take a similar task-based approach to determine a job's exposure to AI.,0.637682,0.261272
20240926.txt,Start by considering what share of a job's tasks can be performed by AI.,0.571184,0.054093
20240926.txt,"For example, we might expect AI to be able to perform a larger share of a software programmer's tasks versus those of a plumber.",0.494185,0.484205
20240926.txt,"Next, for those tasks that can be performed by AI, consider how well AI performs them relative to a typical worker.",0.627538,0.256170
20240926.txt,"For instance, generative AI is used in a medical setting to summarize patient interviewsâa task that it performs quite well relative to a human doctor.",0.624130,0.321920
20240926.txt,"Based on that interview, AI could diagnose a patient and develop a treatment plan, but these are tasks that doctors still tend to perform better than AI.",0.631009,0.406426
20240926.txt,"Finally, for those tasks that can be performed by AI, think about the quality threshold required for that job task.",0.642095,0.208337
20240926.txt,"Coming back to the example of a doctor and AI, while there may be some tolerance for incorrectly summarizing a patient interview, there is little tolerance for misdiagnosing a patient or developing a bad treatment plan.",0.638495,0.188949
20240926.txt,I would also note that we may have higher quality thresholds for AI than we do for human workersâwith driverless cars being an example where AI drivers may be held to a higher standard than human drivers.,0.651483,0.504105
20240926.txt,"Thus, a job will be more exposed to AI, if AI can perform a large share of the job's tasks sufficiently well relative to a human worker and a set of quality thresholds.",0.646048,0.564337
20240926.txt,"Importantly, we can expect that a job's exposure to AI will change over time, because advances in AI technology will both expand the set of tasks that AI can perform and improve the quality of AI's performance of those tasks.",0.436985,0.634081
20240926.txt,Which brings me to my second question for AI's implications for any given job.,0.597005,0.196673

Even for some jobs with a high degree of exposure to AI, it is possible for AI to serve as a complement.",0.547478,0.434465

20240926.txt,"More broadly, jobs with a high degree of exposure to AI will likely be complemented by AI, if workers are able to offload time-intensive, but low value-added, tasks to AI and focus their time on the highest value-added tasks.",0.527335,0.588808
20240926.txt,"However, we can expect that there will be some jobs that have a high degree of exposure to AI and for which AI can perform some especially high-valued tasks.",0.584024,0.579072
20240926.txt,"Thus, AI may be more of a substitute for human labor in these jobs.",0.612691,0.299158

20241018.txt,"However, these arrangements are not without drawbacks.",0.636511,0.598733
20241018.txt,An obvious drawback of intermediation from the perspective of those wishing to trade is that those middlemen must get paid.,0.611790,0.256155
20241018.txt,"That is, there are transaction costs.",0.558069,0.154922
20241018.txt,"Another drawback of intermediation is that you typically must turn over control of your assets, such as savings or stocks, to the intermediary for them to be traded.",0.543471,0.080539
20241018.txt,"This creates a classic ""principal-agent"" problem whereby incentives between the principalâyouâand the agentâthe intermediaryâmay not be aligned.",0.575207,0.202079
20241018.txt,That can raise concerns about custody arrangements and recourse to regain control of one's assets.,0.440630,0.169844
20241018.txt,Intermediation also requires recordkeeping arrangements that customers can trust accurately reflect their true holdings.,0.646863,0.259685
20241018.txt,"In other words, centralized finance requires a substantial amount of trust.",0.640538,0.307356

20241018.txt,Often that occurs through innovations and exploiting new technologies.,0.547570,0.292543
20241018.txt,Think about how the invention of the telegraph and the telephone revolutionized trading.,0.504710,0.164843
20241018.txt,"More recently, the advent of the internet further advanced the ease and speed of financial trading.",0.501379,0.457677
20241018.txt,These are examples of how financial trading has evolved over time.,0.605123,0.209011
20241018.txt,And the next wave of innovations in financial market trading could be driven by technological advances that alleviate some potential drawbacks of the centralized approach.,0.504994,0.616520
20241018.txt,Often broad technological advances emanate from narrower efforts to design products or processes that solve specific problems.,0.579519,0.319940

20241018.txt,An early crypto-assetâBitcoinâwas developed to function in a world in which trust among individuals did not exist.,0.583284,0.211364
20241018.txt,"Rather than relying on intermediaries which require trust, Bitcoin relied on technology to facilitate trade.",0.556102,0.169708
20241018.txt,Bitcoin was also designed for privacy.,0.554169,0.113232
20241018.txt,No one would know who was buying or selling Bitcoin.,0.529790,0.017298
20241018.txt,This was achieved through cryptographic technology and private keys.,0.510009,0.147149

20241018.txt,"That is, they no longer had to delegate control to others.",0.572870,0.109706
20241018.txt,"Finally, all records were kept on a form of distributed ledger called a blockchain, which has design features that promote transparency and are censorship-proof.",0.544660,0.082440
20241018.txt,No individual or government could destroy the records of trades or take ownership of the objects traded.,0.512793,-0.037601
20241018.txt,"With that history in mind and before we delve into the question of whether defi and centralized finance are substitutes or complements, I think it is useful to carefully define some terms.",0.685533,0.274787
20241018.txt,This will make sure we're all talking about the same things.,0.598589,0.268430
20241018.txt,"As I described in a speech last year, I think of the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three parts:

It is easy to see how the emergence of these technologies could lead one to think of defi as a substitute for centralized finance.",0.626462,0.283153
20241018.txt,"For example, the technologies are allowing for individuals to trade assets without giving up control of those assets to an intermediaryâa critical distinction with centralized finance.",0.604223,0.272333
20241018.txt,"However, there are other uses emerging from these technologies that look more like complements to centralized finance.",0.560185,0.363826
20241018.txt,"For example, distributed ledger technology, or DLT, may be an efficient and faster way to do recordkeeping in a 24/7 trading world.",0.542185,0.396178
20241018.txt,We already see several financial institutions experimenting with DLT for traditional repo trading that occurs 24/7.,0.602239,0.356151
20241018.txt,"But before these ledgers can be used to facilitate transactions in traditional assetsâlike debt, equity, and real estateâthese assets must be tokenized.",0.620721,0.128386
20241018.txt,Undertaking the process to tokenize assets and use distributed ledgers like blockchain can speed up transfers of assets and take advantage of another innovation: smart contracts.,0.460042,0.367672
20241018.txt,"Rather than relying on each party to separately carry out the transaction, smart contracts can effectively combine multiple legs of a transaction into a single unified act executed by a smart contract.",0.557123,0.156106
20241018.txt,This can provide value as it can mitigate risks associated with settlement and counterparty risks by ensuring the buyer will not pay if the seller does not deliver.,0.584219,0.542899
20241018.txt,"While these efforts are still in early stages, the functionality could expand to a broad set of financial activities.",0.555622,0.367323
20241018.txt,"The bottom line is that things like DLT, tokenization, and smart contracts are just technologies for trading that can be used in defi or also to improve efficiency in centralized finance.",0.598980,0.263574
20241018.txt,That is why I see them as complements.,0.613006,0.241703

20241018.txt,They provide an opportunity for buyers and sellers to transact in a decentralized fashion with the stablecoin used as the settlement instrument.,0.610367,0.313456
20241018.txt,"Because they are effectively digital currency, stablecoins can reduce the need for payment intermediaries and thereby reduce costs of payments globally.",0.448800,0.636890
20241018.txt,But their safety is not assured.,0.458205,0.216399
20241018.txt,History is replete with cases in which synthetic dollars became subject to runs.,0.462479,0.163893

20241112.txt,And I apply this view to the payments ecosystem.,0.674570,0.268901
20241112.txt,It is that perspective that underlies a question I often ask when forming my positions on the appropriate role the Federal Reserve should play in a wide variety of initiatives: What is the fundamental market inefficiency that would be solved by government intervention and can only be solved by government intervention?,0.682769,0.282080
20241112.txt,"If there isn't a satisfactory answer, then I believe government shouldn't intervene in private markets.",0.702905,0.308804

Thank you, Alvaro, and thank you for the honor of initiating this new series of lectures from central bankers.",0.469593,0.349912
20250108.txt,1 I will begin with a few words on the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy.,0.676973,0.266308
20250108.txt,"But on this occasion, I thought it appropriate to then widen my perspective, to address what I see as the leading challenges that OECD economies face that are of particular importance to central bankers in how we approach monetary policy and our other responsibilities.",0.711608,0.511510
20250108.txt,I continue to believe that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing.,0.391191,0.722096
20250108.txt,Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been above 2 percent for eight of the last nine quarters and is expected to grow above 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024.,0.347353,0.756628

20250108.txt,I have seen nothing in the data or forecasts that suggests the labor market will dramatically weaken over coming months.,0.410136,0.315348
20250108.txt,"With regard to inflation, after a period of rapid disinflation in 2022 and 2023, progress appears to have stalled in the final months of 2024.",0.246422,0.090081
20250108.txt,Our latest reading of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is 2.8 percent for the 12 months ending in November.,0.570172,0.378626
20250108.txt,"This is down just a bit from where it was a year earlier, at 3.2 percent.",0.113100,0.075671
20250108.txt,This minimal further progress has led to calls to slow or stop reducing the policy rate.,0.396648,0.350616
20250108.txt,"However, I believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent goal over the medium term and that further reductions will be appropriate.",0.353700,0.823377
20250108.txt,Let me explain why I expect inflation to continue toward our goal.,0.731337,0.643241
20250108.txt,"First, as we saw a year ago when inflation briefly increased, progress has been uneven, but disinflation is more apparent if one smooths through the recent upticks.",0.607543,0.647913
20250108.txt,"To tease out the underlying trend in inflation, I often look at the six-month percent change in core PCE prices, which is 2.4 percent at an annual rate for November and has mostly been moving down toward 2 percent over the course of the year.",0.473273,0.192791
20250108.txt,"Second, the monthly reading for November came in much lower than expected at 0.11 percent after rising 0.26 percent in October.",0.119403,0.050039
20250108.txt,"Third, inflation in 2024 has largely been driven by increases in imputed prices, such as housing services and nonmarket services, which are estimated rather than directly observed and I consider a less reliable guide to the balance of supply and demand across all goods and services in the economy.",0.614402,0.237421
20250108.txt,These two categories represent about one-third of the core PCE basket.,0.594034,0.208569
20250108.txt,"If you look at the prices associated with the other two-thirds of core PCE, they on average increased less than 2 percent over the past 12 months through November.",0.416136,0.625550
20250108.txt,"I don't support ignoring our best measures of prices for housing and non-market services, but I find it notable that imputed prices, rather than observed prices, were driving inflation in 2024 and thus expectations of the policy rate path.",0.738939,0.583026
20250108.txt,"Finally, the higher inflation readings from early in 2024 will begin to drop out of inflation numbers in January.",0.271033,0.095193
20250108.txt,This should result in a significant step-down in the 12-month inflation numbers through March.,0.378985,0.311703
20250108.txt,"Looking further forward, geopolitical conflict could boost prices, as it has at times in recent years.",0.224387,0.787918
20250108.txt,"In addition, tariff proposals raise the possibility that a new source of upward pressure on inflation could emerge in the coming year.",0.554329,0.743082
20250108.txt,Projections of the economic impact of these possible policy changes vary widely.,0.670436,0.285374
20250108.txt,"If, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view of appropriate monetary policy.",0.777171,0.481359
20250108.txt,"Of course, we need to see what policies are enacted before we can seriously consider their effects.",0.761459,0.441220
20250108.txt,So what is my view?,0.579309,0.107479
20250108.txt,"If the outlook evolves as I have described here, I will support continuing to cut our policy rate in 2025.",0.550251,0.378932
20250108.txt,"The pace of those cuts will depend on how much progress we make on inflation, while keeping the labor market from weakening.",0.739933,0.720327

20250108.txt,Let me now turn to what I consider some of the leading challenges that will frame monetary policy actions for OECD members in 2025 and beyond.,0.705711,0.361022
20250108.txt,"Each of the issues I raise are sizable challenges for all OECD countries, but some are bigger challenges in some places than others.",0.637121,0.435627
20250108.txt,"I have not tried to rank these challenges in importance, so please don't take any signal from the order in which they are raised.",0.677031,0.200577
20250108.txt,I will start with the ongoing challenge all central banks face in reaching our targets for inflation.,0.761710,0.488542
20250108.txt,"While 12-month measures of headline inflation are close to target in most jurisdictions, most central banks target inflation in the medium term, and indicators of the trajectory of future price changes, such as core inflation, are still running persistently above target.",0.486689,0.496187
20250108.txt,"Like the Federal Reserve, most central banks in OECD economies are gradually easing monetary policy as inflation falls.",0.572150,0.588626
20250108.txt,"I believe policy is still restrictive in most cases, which should support the goals of policymakers to have inflation at their targets going forward.",0.768454,0.780922
20250108.txt,"This common challenge, in the months ahead, has its roots, as we all know, in the common experience of the COVID-19 pandemic.",0.613566,0.295584
20250108.txt,"Economic conditions before and during the pandemic varied widely across OECD economies, as did the focus, timing, and forcefulness of policy responses.",0.695139,0.296138
20250108.txt,"The surge in inflation during the pandemic was the result of both supply and demand factors, and while the timing of the inflation surge varied across countries, the COVID inflation was largely a global phenomenon, as shown by research conducted by Federal Reserve staff.",0.590942,0.368340
20250108.txt,"3

A common factor that drove inflation across our economies was the disruption of goods production and delivery.",0.419045,0.241763
20250108.txt,"4 Shortages of key components and waves of COVID variants repeatedly disrupted supply chains, causing inflation to persist.",0.150463,0.140493
20250108.txt,"Fortunately, these disruptions have receded, and delivery times have returned to pre-pandemic levels.",0.297132,0.728540
20250108.txt,"That said, there are many geopolitical factors that are still keeping deliveries of supplies volatile, which potentially could affect economic activity and inflation.",0.321484,0.217106
20250108.txt,Another common experience has been the fiscal response to the pandemic.,0.584183,0.405265
20250108.txt,The extent to which the fiscal policies rolled out in support of households and businesses during the pandemic contributed to inflation is the subject of ongoing debate.,0.452941,0.351229
20250108.txt,"5 Regardless of their effects on inflation, fiscal policy actions across OECD countries led to a doubling and tripling of budget deficits as a percentage of GDP with even larger percentages in some places.",0.222633,0.615183
20250108.txt,"Those deficits have steadily fallen since then but are still higher in many countries than before the pandemic, and debt levels have grown for many OECD members.",0.176838,0.573062
20250108.txt,Another recent challenge for OECD economies is the widespread weakness in manufacturing.,0.202448,0.267641
20250108.txt,"Manufacturing boomed in many places with the onset of the pandemic, when consumers switched their spending from in-person services to goods.",0.356546,0.470079
20250108.txt,"But as businesses and economies reopened with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, the swing to service spending by consumers began what has been a sustained slide in manufacturing in OECD economies.",0.109187,0.223544
20250108.txt,This slide has been compounded by three other factors.,0.296749,0.285119
20250108.txt,"First, because manufacturing is capital intensive, interest rate increases over the past couple of years raised capital costs in this sector.",0.511809,0.682120
20250108.txt,"As monetary policy eases across countries, this effect may unwind.",0.687278,0.522292
20250108.txt,"Also, higher energy costs after Russia's attack on Ukraine have hurt manufacturing more than other sectors.",0.071436,0.121332
20250108.txt,"And lastly, China's push to reduce its reliance on imports and expand its global market share in sectors such as autos has had a big impact across OECD economies.",0.368501,0.727213
20250108.txt,"While the manufacturing sector is a smaller share of economic activity in the United States than in some other OECD countries, we shall see whether the weakness in global manufacturing is affected by the prospect of changes in trade policy in the U.S. and elsewhere.",0.695660,0.545341
20250108.txt,"The extent and timing of tariffs are highly uncertain, as are the effects.",0.682412,0.280492
20250108.txt,"Overall, the evolution of manufacturing adds uncertainty to the forecasts of central bankers' outlooks.",0.484797,0.312713
20250108.txt,A short-to-medium-term challenge that is and will remain widespread among OECD countries is geopolitical risk.,0.634941,0.394728
20250108.txt,"Indexes of geopolitical risk suggest that risks are elevated, but not nearly as high as they were when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",0.433407,0.799970
20250108.txt,"Today however, you certainly can't see much evidence for geopolitical risk affecting financial markets.",0.623844,0.343636
20250108.txt,But geopolitical risk will nevertheless remain a challenge that central bankers will need to keep in mind.,0.743076,0.627279
20250108.txt,"The outbreak of war in Europe and, more recently, in the Middle East were shocking developments that continue to reverberate, as we have seen recently in Syria.",0.458126,0.393394
20250108.txt,"It is unclear how these events will ultimately affect security, trade, and migration flows around the world.",0.642177,0.254967
20250108.txt,The fact that these conflicts have not affected the global economy to a greater extent than they have so far doesn't mean they can't and won't.,0.629034,0.420026
20250108.txt,"Research shows that higher levels of geopolitical risk, and economic uncertainty more broadly, tend to foreshadow lower investment and employment.",0.307832,0.504098
20250108.txt,6 I expect that central bankers in OECD economies will continue to consider geopolitical risk in the medium term.,0.655587,0.637414
20250108.txt,"The next challenge for central bankers that I would like to address also has both shorter and long-term dimensions to it, and that is something that I will refer to as a ""rethink of globalization.""",0.689197,0.341551
20250108.txt,"For close to a decade now, many countries have been reexamining the costs and benefits from steadily freer global movement in capital, labor, and goods that was the norm over previous decades.",0.567687,0.549381
20250108.txt,"Although global trade has not decreased in the last decade, we have clearly seen changes in trade patterns, with more countries and firms putting greater emphasis on rerouting trade flows and shortening supply chains to avoid geopolitical risk and tariffs.",0.567233,0.704989
20250108.txt,This isn't simply the result of some failed ministerial meeting or bilateral conflict.,0.523161,0.053919
20250108.txt,"Rather, it has been a persistent and widespread trend that has been under way for some time.",0.664943,0.488237
20250108.txt,The presumption that the increasingly tighter global integration of our economies and financial markets would inevitably continue is no longer as safe as it long was.,0.586590,0.349985
20250108.txt,"At the same time, I have refrained from calling this development, as some have, the ""end of globalization,"" because I don't believe that this will be the outcome.",0.694454,0.372287
20250108.txt,"As I think about the 38 governments represented by the OECD and consider how this organization has grown in size and in the depth of its engagement on different issues, I would say that globalization is not going away.",0.666841,0.461568
20250108.txt,"What I do expect, however, is there will be more thought and consideration among our leaders for how globalization affects the people we serve, with a more careful weighing of both the potential costs of closer integration and the potential benefits.",0.695854,0.539194
20250108.txt,"As these decisions by governments are made, central bankers will need to be prepared to respond appropriately in setting monetary policy and promoting financial stability.",0.759041,0.607311
20250108.txt,Another longer-term challenge involves demographic trends.,0.620573,0.315415
20250108.txt,"What I mean here is the aging of populations in OECD countries, and, to some extent, everywhere else.",0.608256,0.248669
20250108.txt,"While this is mainly a problem for fiscal authorities, it does have some ramifications for central bankers in terms of long-run growth rates, productivity, and asset prices.",0.724533,0.580108
20250108.txt,"In the United States, those between the ages of 16 and 54 were 72 percent of the population in 2003, 62.7 percent in 2023, and are projected to be 61 percent in 2033.",0.534000,0.286847
20250108.txt,Aging is happening even more quickly in some other OECD countries.,0.521918,0.224859
20250108.txt,"This is a slow-moving development but, as populations age and move from working to retirement, employment and economic output fall.",0.193083,0.084754
20250108.txt,"This by itself lowers per capita GDP, which can affect consumption, investment and inflation.",0.385685,0.261743
20250108.txt,"As aging populations sell accumulated assets to support consumption, asset prices and interest rates will adjust as well, with the latter potentially affecting the central bank's estimate of the neutral policy rate.",0.711723,0.471659
20250108.txt,"There are mitigants to soften the effect of aging populations, such as an increase in retirement age, immigration and higher productivity growth for younger workers.",0.545623,0.708597
20250108.txt,"Again, these demographic factors are more important for fiscal policy, but there are spillovers to monetary policy.",0.710021,0.379456
20250108.txt,Productivity growth is another issue facing central bankers and I know has been the subject of conversations at OECD gatherings this past year.,0.694962,0.452177
20250108.txt,"According to one set of estimates, labor productivity growth is responsible for more than half of the cumulative GDP growth in the United States since the end of 2019, compared to much smaller shares in other countries.",0.502821,0.555258
20250108.txt,"Productivity growth is notoriously volatile and, even years later, it is hard to say exactly what technological and other factors caused it.",0.473745,0.227362
20250108.txt,7 Having some understanding of the trajectory of productivity growth is helpful for policymakers thinking about how fast their economies can grow without inducing inflation.,0.581254,0.617298
20250108.txt,Central bankers must keep their eyes on productivity in judging whether wages can grow quickly without igniting inflation or whether potential growth has increased.,0.733217,0.604050
20250108.txt,"Productivity growth also plays a role in assessing the real neutral policy rate, otherwise known as r*.",0.725886,0.452649
20250108.txt,Higher productivity growth is often associated with a higher value of r* for some policymakers and thus has implications for the interpretation of the degree of monetary accommodation or restrictiveness for policy.,0.659292,0.456200
20250108.txt,"8

One way to try to understand some of the factors affecting productivity is to compare the United States to other OECD countries.",0.655328,0.323867
20250108.txt,"While it is not particularly new for productivity to grow faster in the U.S. than in other advanced economies, some differences in our economies may have been particularly salient during and after the pandemic.",0.593696,0.658098
20250108.txt,"9 First, there was more disruption in employment in the United States during COVID than in many other OECD countries and after the pandemic subsided this may have led to better matching of workers with new jobs at which they could be more productive.",0.341401,0.494322
20250108.txt,"Second, during the acute U.S. labor shortages in 2022 and 2023, I heard numerous anecdotes that firms had to invest more in worker training to raise skill levels to what was necessary for positions.",0.523258,0.548308
20250108.txt,"This raises labor productivity with a delay, and it may have been an important factor recently.",0.636087,0.730771
20250108.txt,"Third, business creation is, by all evidence, easier in the United States, and new firms often are more productive than existing firms.",0.529283,0.468347

20250221.txt,"Using Textual Analysis to Quantify Central Bank Communication Central bank communication is clearly important in shaping the path of interest rates, so it is not surprising that investors and researchers use textual analysis techniques, including artificial intelligence, to quantify in an automated way information conveyed through FOMC statements and other communications, such as speeches by Governors and Fed Bank presidents.",0.620016,0.256401
20250221.txt,8 Researchers have tested the hypothesis that clarity about policy actions would help the transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy.,0.418779,0.697957

20250221.txt,"12 Thus, increased transparency and advances in technology have potentially made asset prices more informationally efficient, which, in turn, helps with the transmission of monetary policy.",0.372844,0.642890

I look forward to the findings of future research as we develop a deeper understanding of this issue.",0.562083,0.436908

20250221.txt,"Some of this research uses textual analysis, and some uses randomized control trials.",0.549608,0.081894
20250221.txt,Researchers have used textual analysis to process automatically and quantify more than 3.2 million posts on social media by experts and nonexperts.,0.543918,0.203389

Central Bank Communication and Monetary Policy Transmission Further, research shows that direct central bank communication and the media's reporting of central bank communication are highly correlated.",0.618422,0.521570
20250221.txt,"Yet when they do not align, the media's reporting tends to have a larger effect on asset prices and professional forecasters' views about the future than the central bank's direct communication.",0.664558,0.258476
20250221.txt,"17 In addition, a randomized control trial with nearly 20,000 U.S. individuals shows that central bank communication affects households' inflation expectations, which, in turn, affects their behavior as measured by scanner-collected data.",0.518151,0.340308
20250221.txt,"18 This research shows that while central bank communication tends to affect household expectations and spending behavior, the way households receive information matters.",0.677928,0.308513
20250221.txt,"In particular, households appear to react more to information conveyed by social media, friends, and family than to information conveyed by traditional media.",0.597025,0.276248
20250221.txt,"All told, this research suggests that central bank efforts to communicate with the general public are having some success, but there is still room for improvement.",0.332170,0.779107
20250221.txt,Measuring Economic Concepts Using Textual Analysis Textual analysis is not only helping researchers understand who is listening to central bank communication.,0.577840,0.268390
20250221.txt,"Generally, it is helping them to measure qualitative information that is hard to capture with numerical forecasts and estimate difficult-to-measure economic concepts such as uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, and financial conditions.",0.640840,0.401719
20250221.txt,"19 As I mentioned in a previous speech, uncertainty is not directly observable in the same way that inflation and economic output are.",0.701122,0.295102
20250221.txt,"20 Notwithstanding the difficulty in measuring uncertainty, researchers have developed tools to assess it.",0.489662,0.550892
20250221.txt,"In fact, in the past two decades, there has been tremendous growth in research devoted to the subject, especially on text-based measures of uncertainty.",0.517311,0.483243
20250221.txt,"For example, researchers created an economic policy uncertainty index, shown in figure 3 , based on the number of leading newspaper articles that contain a combination of words related to economic policy uncertainty.",0.567665,0.180676
20250221.txt,"21 As shown in the figure, economic uncertainty in the U.S. reached an all-time high at the onset of the pandemic, came down slightly after the pandemic, and has recently increased as the potential economic implications of new government policies are discussed in newspaper articles.",0.278341,0.333124
20250221.txt,"Research also shows that newspaper text-based measures are highly correlated with stock price volatility, and that higher values of these measures are associated with lower investment and employment.",0.494185,0.481354
20250221.txt,A corollary to that insight is that policymakers should communicate as clearly as possible to avoid increasing uncertainty.,0.734282,0.607571
20250221.txt,Recent research has also discovered that narrative sentiment conveys information that may be hard to capture in numerical forecasts.,0.554702,0.205380
20250221.txt,"For example, it was shown that the tone of text accompanying a set of economic forecasts produced by the Fed's staff, predicts forecast errors of the Fed's staff as well as Blue Chip participants.",0.616850,0.253603
20250221.txt,"22 The predictive power of sentiment seems to be arising from signaling the downside risks to economic performance for output, employment, and stock returns.",0.567919,0.503837
20250221.txt,These findings suggest that the tone of the narrative captures information that is not necessarily provided by corresponding forecasts.,0.664097,0.248218
20250221.txt,"Not surprisingly, given this information, the tonality has predictive power for stock prices as well as monetary policy surprises.",0.619190,0.483940
20250221.txt,Another example of how textual analysis is helping researchers estimate difficult-to-measure concepts is new measures of firms' demand and supply shocks.,0.572764,0.364991
20250221.txt,"Traditionally, academic researchers use sign restrictions in price and quantity measures to identify and differentiate demand shocks from supply shocks.",0.684481,0.303519
20250221.txt,An increase in price and quantity is considered a demand shock; an increase in price accompanied by a decline in quantity is considered a supply shock.,0.476493,0.371615
20250221.txt,"These so-called sign restrictions are useful tools; however, it is possible that an increase in price and quantity can be due to a surge in demand in the face of supply chain disruptions.",0.541442,0.666035
20250221.txt,Other popular measures of supply chain disruptions are supplier delivery times and order backlogs provided by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).,0.493521,0.162534
20250221.txt,"These measures, however, only estimate firm activity relative to the previous month and can lack important context for understanding short-term dynamics that can otherwise be captured in qualitative, text-based measures.",0.691032,0.287101
20250221.txt,"Thus, it can be useful to complement sign restriction methods, supplier delivery times, and order backlogs with textual analysis techniques that quantify firms' narratives in earnings calls and the Beige Book to identify better demand and supply shocks.",0.592972,0.403945
20250221.txt,"23 For example, figure 4 shows the Supply Chain Bottleneck Sentiment Index, the solid black line, estimated by a Board economist using textual analysis techniques to quantify the information conveyed in the Fed's Beige Book publications, along with the ISM Supplier Delivery Index, the dashed red line.",0.640315,0.274890
20250221.txt,"24 For illustration purposes, both indexes are normalized to have a zero mean and a standard deviation equal to one, with large positive numbers indicating that supply chains are stressed.",0.635570,0.599269
20250221.txt,Both indexes surged in the 1970s after the oil price increase and ensuing energy crisis.,0.267399,0.601817
20250221.txt,"Supply chain disruptions reappeared in the 2000s with chip shortages, and, most recently, bottlenecks arose during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0.280393,0.152090
20250221.txt,The figure illustrates how the text-based measure signals a more prolonged period of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.,0.558373,0.453771
20250221.txt,"Comparing both measures, we see that the monthly changes in delivery times improved at a fast pace, as shown in the ISM index, but narratives of the post-pandemic recovery, as captured in the Beige Book, were signaling elevated levels of supply chain disruptions that eased more slowly.",0.242777,0.737954
20250221.txt,"Conclusion The idea of using qualitative information on media, government records, central bank, or management communication in economic research to understand better the transmission of monetary policy is not new.",0.607366,0.331607
20250221.txt,"25 What is novel is that, in the past two decades, there have been advances in textual analysis techniques and incredible growth of data that are easily available to researchers and investors, in terms of both volume and variety.",0.438736,0.465602
20250221.txt,"The advances in textual analysis techniques and the growth in alternative data have, in turn, helped researchers to better estimate difficult-to-measure economic concepts, to more easily identify who listens to central bank communications, and to investigate how quickly central bank communication is incorporated into asset prices, among other things.",0.503308,0.469139
20250221.txt,"Also, we have greater access to high-frequency data, such as millisecond timestamp financial transactions, and ""alternative data,"" which includes textual information from social media posts.",0.574139,0.386596
20250221.txt,"As I mentioned earlier, these new textual analysis techniques are important to policymakers because we seek to understand how our communications are being heard, interpreted, understood, and acted upon.",0.610135,0.354285
20250221.txt,"While I am grateful that textual analysis techniques and data access have improved over the years, I will end on a cautionary note.",0.587112,0.515902
20250221.txt,Automatic textual analysis should not be regarded as superseding other analysis of the historical record on monetary policy.,0.674725,0.181738
20250221.txt,A wealth of data and techniques to analyze text does not necessarily translate into greater insight.,0.617223,0.350625
20250221.txt,"Therefore, it is important that policymakers, researchers, and investors continue to be diligent in using the right tools and the right data to make the best possible inferences.",0.704356,0.489021

20250227.txt,There were a number of factors driving that decision that guided how we designed the Program.,0.616028,0.258786
20250227.txt,"First, we understood that the pace of innovation was rapid.",0.613886,0.522826

20250227.txt,So we tasked the Novel Program with monitoring and understanding how these innovations and associated novel activities are used in banking and what benefits and risks they would pose.,0.617727,0.307682
20250227.txt,We gave them the mandate to keep up with the expertise related to use of new technologies and to employ new tools and data analytics in supervision.,0.557575,0.508581

Governor Michelle W. Bowman

At the 2025 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, New York, New York

Thank you for the invitation to participate at this year's U.S. Monetary Policy Forum conference.",0.485031,0.247946
20250307.txt,It is a pleasure to be here to discuss the conference report and present my views on the transmission of monetary policy to real activity in recent years.,0.568730,0.340819
20250307.txt,1 I would like to start by thanking the authors of the paper for their thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the effects of monetary policy on economic activity.,0.580124,0.402795
20250307.txt,"As you all may know, my background is in banking and bank regulation, so my experience with and interest in understanding the transmission and effects of monetary policy stems from my responsibilities as a Member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).",0.615383,0.236950
20250307.txt,"Turning to the discussion, I will begin with a few comments and suggestions on the paper and then focus on how monetary policy and other factors influenced U.S. economic performance during the tightening cycle that started in March 2022.",0.697000,0.273270
20250307.txt,I will then conclude with some thoughts on the relevance of the results in the paper for monetary policy going forward.,0.690199,0.343755
20250307.txt,"Comments and Suggestions on ""Monetary Policy Transmission to Real Activity"" The paper's stated purpose is to estimate how monetary policy shocks affect gross domestic product (GDP) and employment through the use of a range of models.",0.675443,0.235656
20250307.txt,"The evidence is generally similar to previous studies, supporting the broader principle that monetary policy exerts its effects with long lags and has a limited contribution to changes in real activity when the shock is small and not very persistent.",0.756576,0.532245
20250307.txt,"We should keep in mind, however, that many other shocks hit the economy and that at times it may be hard to see the effects of monetary policy actions estimated in the paper as they work through the actual economy.",0.729179,0.394685
20250307.txt,"The paper notes that a 1 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate that retraces gradually, taking five to six quarters to reach half of its initial size, has persistent negative effects on GDP and employment.",0.221717,0.199078
20250307.txt,"At maximum, this shock lowers GDP by 0.4 percent in about 18 months and employment by 0.3 percent in about two years, on average across the models considered in the paper.",0.198512,0.196103
20250307.txt,"However, there is a wide range of estimated responses, as they depend on each model specification and the data used.",0.646507,0.163004
20250307.txt,"The most sensitive components of GDP are residential investment, business fixed investment, and durable goods consumption, which is consistent with employment in the construction and durable goods manufacturing industries being highly interest-rate sensitive.",0.657366,0.446466
20250307.txt,"The paper analyzes the transmission of monetary policy to real activity, but it would have been very interesting to go one step further and also see the effects of monetary policy on inflation.",0.697915,0.413753
20250307.txt,This is especially relevant because the FOMC has been focused on bringing inflation down to its 2 percent target over the past few years.,0.460886,0.452244
20250307.txt,"Of course, higher interest rates lower inflation by dampening aggregate demand and real activity, thereby removing pressure on resource utilization, wages, and prices.",0.632693,0.661623
20250307.txt,The authors use several models to analyze the transmission of monetary policy.,0.630546,0.213346
20250307.txt,"They use two well-known structural models created by Federal Reserve Board staff that have been used in Tealbook, the FRB/US and EDO models, in addition to two reduced-form VAR models, the New York Fed Bayesian VAR model and a simple four-variable proxy VAR model.",0.574799,0.161187
20250307.txt,"It is reassuring that the estimated responses to a federal funds rate shock in the two models that I am most familiar with, the Board FRB/US and EDO models, seem consistent with previous findings.",0.675778,0.540811
20250307.txt,"2

One small issue is that neither of the VAR models directly includes the federal funds rate.",0.681595,0.268905
20250307.txt,"The authors acknowledge this limitation in the analysis and address it by roughly estimating that a 100-basis points shock to the policy rate boosts the 1-year and 2âyear Treasury yields by 45 and 40 basis points, respectively.",0.438404,0.737454
20250307.txt,This approach may have resulted in the implied monetary policy shock in the two VAR models looking more persistent than in the two structural models.,0.471699,0.309529
20250307.txt,"I would suggest the authors take another look at this aspect of their exercise, so that the contours of the monetary policy shocks look more similar across the different models.",0.700943,0.401376
20250307.txt,An alternative approach would have been to take the 1- and 2-year averages of the federal funds rate from the FRB/US and EDO impulse responses and possibly add a small term premium.,0.691075,0.431680
20250307.txt,This approach would have suggested larger effects of the federal funds rate shock on the 1- and 2-year Treasury yields than estimated by the authors.,0.508474,0.310823
20250307.txt,"Another approach, especially in the proxy VAR setting, would have been to use a measure of the shadow federal funds rate, which provides a gauge of the overall monetary policy stance and is not constrained by the zero lower bound.",0.755356,0.353989
20250307.txt,"3

The paper focused on the effect of changes in the policy rate, but an important channel for the transmission of monetary policy is how it affects private interest rates that are relevant for households and businesses consumption and investment decisions.",0.712261,0.341514
20250307.txt,"Private rates include interest rates charged on outstanding credit card balances, rates on auto and other durable goods loans, mortgage rates, and corporate bond yields.",0.623954,0.148571
20250307.txt,"Although credit card rates move closely in line with the policy rate and include a time-varying spread that depends on the default risk profile of the borrower, longer-term private fixed rates on mortgages and corporate bonds depend on the expected path of the federal funds rate, the term premium embedded in longer-term Treasury yields, and risk spreads relative to Treasury securities of comparable maturity.",0.719391,0.281774
20250307.txt,"Accordingly, monetary policy tools other than the policy rate, including forward guidance and the amount of securities holdings in the central bank's balance sheet, are also important for the transmission of monetary policy since they can more forcefully affect the expected path of the federal funds rate, term premiums, and risk spreads.",0.698631,0.395989
20250307.txt,The authors analyze the contribution of major aggregate demand components to the overall effect of a monetary policy shock on GDP.,0.588089,0.437668
20250307.txt,One minor issue is that not all the models treat business investment equally.,0.676009,0.273720
20250307.txt,"In particular, the EDO model includes inventory investment under business investment, while all other models do not appear to do so.",0.656889,0.173179
20250307.txt,"This difference may contribute to the much larger initial reaction of business investment in the EDO model compared to the other models, as inventory investment reacts quickly to a shock in the federal funds rate.",0.622439,0.455229
20250307.txt,I would like to offer one last comment on the relatively small effect of monetary policy on real activity.,0.682986,0.285716
20250307.txt,"Although I do not disagree with the authors' assessment, I think that the estimated effects can cumulate to be quite sizable even for the transient unexpected shock considered.",0.684194,0.523754
20250307.txt,The FOMC quickly raised interest rates to fight surging inflation between March 2022 and July 2023 by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points.,0.444124,0.790729
20250307.txt,"According to the average impulse responses, a shock of this magnitude would lead to declines of about 2 percent on the level of real GDP and 1.5 percent on the level of employment, which would translate into a similarly large increase in the unemployment rate if those who lost their jobs mostly remained in the labor force.",0.189896,0.217465
20250307.txt,"This seems to suggest the potential for fairly large effects on real activity, especially when the monetary policy shock has more persistent effects on the policy rate and results in larger increases in term premiums and risk spreads.",0.622710,0.701367
20250307.txt,The Recent Tightening Cycle The FOMC started raising the federal funds rate in March 2022 to combat rising inflation.,0.678099,0.661651
20250307.txt,"Although the initial rate hike was a mere 1/4 percentage point, the pace of tightening was faster over the remainder of the year, with an overall increase of more than 4 percentage points in the policy rate by the end of 2022.",0.418245,0.771313
20250307.txt,"Rate hikes continued in smaller 1/4 percentage point steps the following year, adding to 1 additional percentage point increase by July 2023.",0.439063,0.741949
20250307.txt,"As the authors note in the paper, the rapid pace of monetary policy tightening was somewhat surprising, especially as the FOMC was initially slow to react to signs that the rise in inflation during 2021 was not merely transitory and required more aggressive action.",0.554214,0.704742
20250307.txt,"As financial conditions tightened rapidly and the yield curve inverted in 2022, fears of an impending recession started to rise, with Federal Reserve Board staff mentioning downside risks to real activity and that a mild recession seemed equally likely to the baseline Tealbook projection for sluggish economic growth over the next year.",0.262467,0.496911
20250307.txt,4 The staff eventually predicted a mild recession in the Tealbook forecast after the bank failures and banking system stress in the spring of 2023.,0.188192,0.242804
20250307.txt,"5 Such recession was widely predicted and, in hindsight, it never materialized.",0.379658,0.278198
20250307.txt,"As you well know, the yield curve inversion has not been the only predictor of recessions that has failed in recent years.",0.537850,0.445210
20250307.txt,"On a Q4-over-Q4 basis, GDP growth slowed considerably in 2022 to a modest pace of only 1.3 percent.",0.219160,0.172594
20250307.txt,"The components of GDP that exerted the most drag on growth that year were residential investment, goods consumption, and inventory investment, subtracting a total of 1â1/2 percentage points from real GDP growth in 2022.",0.503589,0.398622
20250307.txt,Residential investment weakened rather quickly and fell more than 16 percent in 2022.,0.062761,0.031526
20250307.txt,"The sharp decline in this category seems largely explained by higher mortgage rates, which surged more than 3 percentage points over the course of the year as the FOMC aggressively tightened monetary policy.",0.285202,0.514627
20250307.txt,"In addition to higher interest rates, the 1-1/2 percent drop in goods consumption in 2022 likely reflected the imprint of higher inflation on real disposable income and the unwinding of previous fiscal stimulus.",0.143926,0.153184
20250307.txt,"Somewhat at odds with the empirical results in the paper, business fixed investment continued to rise appreciably as special factors led to a delayed response to the rise in interest rates.",0.256465,0.684779
20250307.txt,"A broader measure of business investment that includes inventories did show a slowdown in growth, but even this broad measure continued to rise appreciably in 2022. Business fixed investment was likely supported by construction of new microchip and battery plants, the continued boost to software investment following the switch to remote work, and a rebound in nonresidential structures and transportation equipment investment after their protracted decline over the pandemic.",0.279799,0.696979
20250307.txt,"Payroll employment increased strongly in 2022 as labor force participation rose, the unemployment rate declined, and the labor market tightened considerably.",0.184362,0.735761
20250307.txt,Payroll employment moved back up to its pre-pandemic level and approached its trend as social distancing receded.,0.231374,0.699530
20250307.txt,The recovery dynamics in employment largely masked any effects from rising interest rates in 2022.,0.459362,0.619966
20250307.txt,"The effect from higher interest rates on employment also tends to lag and be more persistent than the effect on GDP, so any effects likely showed up in 2023, an outcome that is consistent with the findings in the paper.",0.641336,0.596974
20250307.txt,Some Reasons Why the Economy Outperformed The economy outperformed in 2023 as widespread predictions of an impending recession never materialized and instead growth picked up.,0.338572,0.557163
20250307.txt,"From the point of view of the models in the paper, the stronger economy in 2023 also seems surprising, but this likely reflected other factors that influenced the economy and that are not accounted for in the model simulations.",0.646735,0.274634
20250307.txt,"Despite significant tightening in broad financial conditions in 2023, GDP growth strengthened notably as fiscal policy turned from a drag into a meaningful boost to growth and potential output accelerated further due to increased immigration and strong productivity growth.",0.065617,0.683378
20250307.txt,These favorable supply developments allowed for stronger economic activity along with easing of inflationary pressures.,0.240516,0.800790
20250307.txt,"Although growth surprised to the upside in 2023, labor market tightness eased with the unemployment rate edging up over the year and payroll employment growth slowing markedly.",0.145611,0.611597
20250307.txt,"Faster GDP growth in 2023 was driven by a rebound in goods consumption, some recovery in residential investment, and stronger government spending.",0.218056,0.752509
20250307.txt,"Goods consumption was boosted by strong gains in real compensation and personal income, including from declining inflation.",0.157510,0.699800

20250307.txt,"In particular, the labor market remained strong and household balance sheets were still healthy.",0.365336,0.726133
20250307.txt,The sharp rise in mortgage rates also created a lockâin effect that increased demand for new housing and construction activity.,0.312931,0.457444
20250307.txt,"The marked deceleration in employment in 2023 seems consistent with the longer lags in the response of employment to the rise in interest rates relative to that of GDP, especially as a significant portion of employment gains reflected increased labor supply from immigration, which allowed the labor market to come into better balance.",0.434814,0.677652
20250307.txt,"Also consistent with the paper results, employment gains in the construction and durable goods manufacturing industries were more noticeably below their 2015-2019 trends than employment gains for the aggregate economy.",0.142579,0.151318
20250307.txt,"As the authors argue, another reason why real activity was more resilient in the face of higher interest rates may have been the healthy balance sheets of households and businesses at the start of the tightening cycle.",0.545649,0.745884

In addition, many households and nonfinancial businesses were able to refinance their mortgages and corporate bonds at very low rates during the pandemic.",0.447371,0.641547

20250307.txt,One way to describe the resiliency of real activity to higher interest rates during the recent tightening cycle is to say that some of the previously noted factors led to a rise in r-star.,0.507481,0.754619
20250307.txt,"Higher population growth, from the influx of new immigrants, and higher productivity growth, arguably from the use of new technologies like artificial intelligence and the surge in new business formations, especially in high-tech industries, have likely boosted investment demand.",0.219907,0.695939

20250307.txt,"In the case of the United States, unusually high rates of retirement during the 2021â22 period played an important role, a phenomenon driven by, among other factors, increases in wealth fueled by gains in the stock market and rising home prices.",0.524927,0.599858
20250307.txt,"12 Of course, another factor driving the drag in U.S. participation has been the aging of the population and the expected ongoing retirement of baby boomers.",0.297871,0.217876
20250307.txt,"By contrast, the euro area saw the LFPRs surpass their pre-pandemic levels by early 2022, as policies in these countries promoted job retention.",0.326333,0.652414

20250307.txt,"18

U.S. labor market policies that rely more heavily on UI may have contributed to higher productivity growth in the United States, and to our recovery from the effects of the pandemic, by better matching the skills of individuals with jobs that make the best use of those skills.",0.351969,0.699077

20250307.txt,The third important factor boosting labor supply since the pandemic was increased immigration in a number of countries.,0.276511,0.702955

20250324.txt,Addressing the Need for Financial Transparency A significant challenge facing small businesses is the absence of policies providing essential tools and protection for small business borrowers.,0.522349,0.325010

20250324.txt,"Consider the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), implemented in Regulation Z, which does not extend protection to small business borrowers.",0.646544,0.250759
20250324.txt,11 This exclusion stems partly from the assumption that small business owners possess financial sophistication or can access professional assistance when needed.,0.614640,0.243004
20250324.txt,This regulatory gap matters because business financing offers may present pricing structures that differ substantially from the standardized disclosures that small business owners are accustomed to seeing on consumer credit disclosures.,0.629276,0.345490
20250324.txt,Research from focus groups conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland revealed that many small business owners struggle with understanding the specialized terminology used by certain nonbank lenders.,0.428028,0.164714

20250324.txt,This might lead business owners to focus more on quick access to funds or low initial payments rather than evaluating the complete long-term cost structure.,0.714589,0.461446
20250324.txt,"Similarly, status quo bias suggests that once a small business borrower establishes a lending relationship, they may be less inclined to explore alternatives, even when more favorable options become available.",0.665378,0.559746
20250324.txt,The perceived complexity or uncertainty of refinancing or switching lenders can reinforce this tendency to maintain existing arrangements.,0.547585,0.367360
20250324.txt,Understanding psychological factors and cognitive biases can help small business borrowers make more informed financial decisions by recognizing how the presentation of lending terms might affect their evaluation process.,0.633245,0.507204

20250324.txt,"13 This requirement gives borrowers the opportunity to understand the financing being offered in a clear, concise manner, enabling informed comparisons across different product options.",0.556632,0.458625
20250324.txt,"Several other states passed versions of disclosure laws for small business financing transactions, with some variability over the range of financing transactions covered and the types of disclosures required.",0.606275,0.266739

20250404.txt,There are several factors contributing to our current state.,0.610927,0.271451
20250404.txt,Let me highlight some key reasons.,0.603002,0.220606
20250404.txt,"Of course, one reason is that banks are being appropriately cautious in the highly regulated environment in which they operate.",0.751785,0.462231
20250404.txt,"Beyond that, for some of these applications, the technology is not fully mature.",0.657164,0.249362
20250404.txt,"For instance, Gen AI systems may still hallucinate, generating plausible sounding but inaccurate information.",0.414337,0.042513

20250404.txt,"This is tough to square with the requirements of banking, where decisions must be well-controlled, numerically and legally precise, explainable, and replicable.",0.670139,0.264251
20250404.txt,Information security is another key concern.,0.639367,0.325868
20250404.txt,"To the extent that a Gen AI-powered agent is accessing sensitive customer data and authorizing transactions, it becomes an attractive target for malicious actors.",0.578033,0.326856
20250404.txt,"6 Further, as Gen AI models process vast amounts of data, there's a risk that proprietary or customer information could be inadvertently included in the model's outputs or responses, leading to legal violations and privacy breaches.",0.340200,0.066614
20250404.txt,"Moreover, business processes at banks have not evolved to optimize Gen AI usage.",0.714194,0.389102

20250404.txt,There are a few reasons why this may be the case.,0.606126,0.278923

20250422.txt,Details of Monetary Policy Transmission Monitoring the financial conditions I just described is one important way I evaluate how well the Fed's monetary policy is being transmitted to the rest of the economy.,0.692220,0.355165
20250422.txt,But it is not the only way.,0.619002,0.223061
20250422.txt,I also consider two other elements that play important roles in the transmission of our monetary policy.,0.660408,0.356825
20250422.txt,Timing Matters The first element to evaluate is the timing with which monetary policy affects the macroeconomy.,0.683544,0.197067
20250422.txt,"The contemporary economics literature uses a variety of statistical models to estimate the effects of what are called monetary policy ""shocks.""",0.624499,0.227719
20250422.txt,Those are movements in the policy rate that are not explained by estimates of how monetary policy systematically responds to incoming economic and financial data and are not anticipated by the public.,0.666801,0.142071
20250422.txt,9 Focusing on the estimated effects of these shocks helps isolate the consequences solely coming from monetary policy actions and communications.,0.644991,0.347777
20250422.txt,"One lesson that emerges from this research is that, broadly speaking, it turns out that Milton Friedman's ""long and variable lags"" concept still holds.",0.622799,0.447129
20250422.txt,10 A selection of key studies on the topic estimates that it takes about one to two years for the maximum effects of policy to be observed in economic activity and inflation.,0.666394,0.332694
20250422.txt,"11 These long lags in monetary policy affecting the economy point to why it is important for policymakers to anticipate economic conditions as best as possible and try to be proactive about understanding the effects of different shocks to the economy, so they can act quickly when needed.",0.740824,0.550759
20250422.txt,Direction of Travel The second element to consider when making decisions related to monetary policy is whether its transmission has been equally impactful during different points in time.,0.735629,0.361023
20250422.txt,"For example, credible evidence indicates that contractionary monetary shocks may generally decrease economic activity more strongly than expansionary shocks increase it.",0.527023,0.434962
20250422.txt,"12 To understand these asymmetric effects, consider the following illustrative metaphor used by Marriner Eccles, who led the Fed back in the 1930s.",0.608191,0.223563
20250422.txt,Imagine a string with monetary policy at one end and the economy at the other.,0.657549,0.212017
20250422.txt,Employing tight monetary policy when inflation is rising is like pulling on the string to keep the economy in checkâit works fairly well.,0.644872,0.470116
20250422.txt,But attempting to stimulate the economy with loose policy during a downturn is like trying to push on the string to move the economyâa more difficult task.,0.664484,0.426785
20250422.txt,"There is evidence of this asymmetry in consumer spending on long-lasting durable goods, such as vehicles and appliances.",0.533414,0.418909
20250422.txt,"While an easier monetary policy may lower interest rates and thus stimulate spending on durable goods in the near term, the effects of that policy may be smaller over time, as households may have already purchased durable goods.",0.539809,0.800804
20250422.txt,"13 If a family replaces their living room furniture when rates are low, they are unlikely to need a new set of furniture a few years later and thus would not consider how current rates would change their decisions.",0.646663,0.198821
20250422.txt,"Thus, during an easing cycle, it is reasonable to suspect that the potency of monetary policy may be somewhat diminished.",0.527917,0.394359
20250422.txt,Another example of asymmetry can be seen in the transmission of monetary policy to private lending.,0.646969,0.273084
20250422.txt,"Board staff research documented strong growth in the period between the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic, fueled by structural factors, such as the attractiveness of the market to borrowers and investors due to its higher customization.",0.191467,0.686605
20250422.txt,14 One implication of this strong growth during this past policy tightening is that monetary policy transmission to private credit markets appeared more muted relative to financing through public credit markets or bank commercial and industrial lending.,0.704004,0.494257
20250422.txt,"By contrast, other factors specific to the recent period likely decreased the potency of monetary policy during the tightening cycle but may increase it during the easing cycle.",0.404734,0.428157
20250422.txt,"When the pandemic struck and social distancing was common, many households severely curtailed spending.",0.163084,0.032997
20250422.txt,"In addition, a historic level of government transfers boosted household income.",0.237199,0.680886
20250422.txt,This combination led the personal savings rate to soar.,0.299504,0.739748
20250422.txt,15 Recent work by Board staff suggests that these excess savings accumulated during the pandemic may have reduced the effects of tighter monetary policy over recent years.,0.340784,0.735703
20250422.txt,"16 If households are flush with excess cash, they are less likely to respond to elevated interest rates by curtailing demand.",0.344490,0.368984
20250422.txt,"Instead, they may have funds to avoid financing or may feel they are able to afford higher monthly payments.",0.410637,0.549749
20250422.txt,"Now, some five years after the pandemic began, these excess savings are exhausted.",0.500822,0.212889
20250422.txt,"17 This creates an environment in which monetary policy could be having its average effects on the household sector, although we should consider that the financial health of borrowers with lower credit scores has deteriorated meaningfully in recent years and credit card and auto loan delinquencies are now above pre-pandemic levels.",0.245752,0.343094
20250422.txt,"For these households, easing monetary policy may have larger effects.",0.558198,0.621114

20250422.txt,"Also, I am humbly aware that it is difficult for economists to judge the overall effect of monetary policy actions on the U.S. economy in real time.",0.741800,0.347515
20250422.txt,"Conclusion To summarize, I see inflation still running above the 2 percent target while the labor market has remained stable.",0.653816,0.676156
20250422.txt,"But the economy is facing heightened uncertainty, with upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment.",0.373756,0.492681

20250422.txt,"As a result, the economic effects of tariffs and the associated uncertainty are also likely to be larger than anticipated.",0.552891,0.613292
20250422.txt,"It is important for monetary policymakers to broadly examine all available information, including market-based measures, surveys, and anecdotal reports, to understand what is happening in the economy as early as possible because, as I discussed, it takes time for policy to have an impact.",0.746979,0.346374
20250422.txt,"As the direction of the economy changes, it is critical to pay close attention to real-time data and to consider the lags and asymmetries of policy transmission to ensure we respond not only to the actual movements on both sides of the mandate, but also to the risks to the economic outlook.",0.805864,0.513276
20250422.txt,"As I observe the economy and consider the appropriate path of monetary policy, I am closely studying how the decisions the FOMC makes are transmitted through the economy.",0.700857,0.270177
20250422.txt,"We have learned much about how those transmission channels work and how they may have changed in recent years, and there is much more to learn.",0.651030,0.298234
