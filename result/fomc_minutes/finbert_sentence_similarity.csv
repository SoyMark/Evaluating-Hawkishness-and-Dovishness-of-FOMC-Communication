20180131.txt,Inflation Analysis and Forecasting The staff presented three briefings on inflation analysis and forecasting.,0.610957,0.238460
20180131.txt,The presentations reviewed a number of commonly used structural and reduced-form models.,0.570964,0.192573
20180131.txt,These included structural models in which the rate of inflation is linked importantly to measures of resource slack and a measure of expected inflation relevant for wage and price setting--so-called Phillips curve specifications--as well as statistical models in which inflation is primarily determined by a time-varying inflation trend or longer-run inflation expectations.,0.683055,0.287088
20180131.txt,The briefings noted several factors beyond those captured in the models that appeared to have put downward pressure on prices in recent years.,0.497571,0.382839
20180131.txt,"These included structural changes in price setting for some items, such as medical care, and the effects of idiosyncratic price shocks, such as the unusual drop in prices of wireless telephone services in 2017.",0.426454,0.327658
20180131.txt,The staff found little compelling evidence for the possible influence of other factors such as a more competitive pricing environment or a change in the markup of prices over unit labor costs.,0.657793,0.506710
20180131.txt,"Overall, for the set of models presented, the prediction errors in recent years were larger than those observed during the 2001-07 period but were consistent with historical norms and, in most models, did not appear to be biased.",0.594054,0.446245
20180131.txt,"The staff presentations considered two key channels by which monetary policy influences inflation--the response of inflation to changes in resource utilization and the role of inflation expectations, or trend inflation, in the price-setting process.",0.735278,0.400551
20180131.txt,"In part because inflation was importantly influenced by a number of short-lived factors, the effects of current and expected resource utilization gaps on inflation were not easy to discern empirically.",0.688679,0.406336
20180131.txt,Estimates of the strength of those effects had diminished noticeably in recent years.,0.242590,0.184159
20180131.txt,"The briefings highlighted a number of other challenges associated with estimating the strength and timing of the linkage between resource utilization and inflation, including the reliability of and changes over time in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and potential output and the ability to adequately account for supply shocks.",0.635011,0.466932
20180131.txt,"In addition, some research suggested that the relationship between resource utilization and inflation may be nonlinear, with the response of inflation increasing as rates of utilization rise to very high levels.",0.564048,0.598051
20180131.txt,"With regard to inflation expectations, two of the briefings presented findings that the longer-run trend in inflation, absent cyclical disturbances or transitory fluctuations, had been stable in recent years at a little below 2 percent.",0.521599,0.791703
20180131.txt,"The briefings reported that the average forecasting performance of models employing either statistical estimates of inflation trends or survey-based measures of inflation expectations as proxies for inflation expectations appeared comparable, even though different versions of such models could yield very different forecasts at any given point in time.",0.566288,0.647782
20180131.txt,"Moreover, al­though survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations tended to move in parallel with estimated inflation trends, the empirical research provided no clear guidance on how to construct a measure of inflation expectations that would be the most useful for inflation forecasting.",0.744788,0.432041
20180131.txt,"The staff noted that al­though reduced-form models in which inflation tends to revert toward longer-run inflation trends described the data reasonably well, those models offered little guidance to policymakers on how to conduct policy so as to achieve their desired outcome for inflation.",0.671945,0.412904
20180131.txt,"Following the staff presentations, participants discussed how the inflation frameworks reviewed in the briefings informed their views on inflation and monetary policy.",0.689524,0.330268
20180131.txt,Almost all participants who commented agreed that a Phillips curve-type of inflation framework remained useful as one of their tools for understanding inflation dynamics and informing their decisions on monetary policy.,0.678079,0.574210
20180131.txt,Policymakers pointed to a number of possible reasons for the difficulty in estimating the link between resource utilization and inflation in recent years.,0.578334,0.401806
20180131.txt,"These reasons included an extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and other advanced economies during which the effects of resource utilization on inflation became harder to identify, the shortcomings of commonly used measures of resource gaps, the effects of transitory changes in relative prices, and structural factors that had made business pricing more competitive or prices more flexible over time.",0.629536,0.445168
20180131.txt,It was noted that research focusing on inflation across U.S. states or metropolitan areas continued to find a significant relationship between price or wage inflation and measures of resource gaps.,0.527836,0.666737
20180131.txt,"A couple of participants questioned the usefulness of a Phillips curve-type framework for policymaking, citing the limited ability of such frameworks to capture the relationship between economic activity and inflation.",0.327433,0.149827
20180131.txt,"Participants generally agreed that inflation expectations played a fundamental role in understanding and forecasting inflation, with stable inflation expectations providing an important anchor for the rate of inflation over the longer run.",0.688253,0.665844
20180131.txt,"Participants acknowledged that the causes of movements in short- and longer-run inflation expectations, including the role of monetary policy, were imperfectly understood.",0.518840,0.232249
20180131.txt,"They commented that various proxies for inflation expectations--readings from household and business surveys or from economic forecasters, estimates derived from market prices, or estimated trends--were imperfect measures of actual inflation expectations, which are unobservable.",0.491458,0.143048
20180131.txt,"That said, participants emphasized the critical need for the FOMC to maintain a credible longer-run inflation objective and to clearly communicate the Committee's commitment to achieving that objective.",0.601489,0.726104
20180131.txt,Several participants indicated that they viewed the available evidence as suggesting that longer-run inflation expectations remained well anchored; one cited recent research finding that inflation expectations had become better anchored following the Committee's adoption of a numerical inflation target.,0.456083,0.811022
20180131.txt,"However, a few saw low levels of inflation over recent years as reflecting, in part, slippage in longer-run inflation expectations below the Committee's 2 percent objective.",0.349530,0.293240
20180131.txt,"In that regard, a number of participants noted the importance of continuing to emphasize that the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective is symmetric.",0.760011,0.723318
20180131.txt,A couple of participants suggested that the Committee might consider expressing its objective as a range rather than a point estimate.,0.714518,0.373888
20180131.txt,"A few other participants suggested that the FOMC could begin to examine whether adopting a monetary policy framework in which the Committee would strive to make up for past deviations of inflation from target might address the challenge of achieving and maintaining inflation expectations consistent with the Committee's inflation objective, particularly in an environment in which the neutral rate of interest appeared likely to remain low.",0.775267,0.745514
20180131.txt,Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the January 30-31 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through December and that real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at about a 2-1/2 percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year.,0.272660,0.760126

20191030.txt,Ongoing capacity for repo operations could be viewed as useful in an ample-reserves regime as a way of providing insurance against unexpected stresses in money markets that could drive the federal funds rate outside the Committee's target range over a sustained period.,0.700343,0.699171
20191030.txt,The staff presented two potential approaches for conducting repo operations if the Committee decided to maintain an ongoing role for such operations.,0.640324,0.430693
20191030.txt,"Under the first approach, the Desk would conduct modestly sized, relatively frequent repo operations designed to provide a high degree of readiness should the need for larger operations arise; under the second approach, the FOMC would establish a standing fixed-rate facility that could serve as an automatic money market stabilizer.",0.665261,0.464687
20191030.txt,"8 Assessing these two approaches involved several considerations, including the degree of assurance of control over the federal funds rate, the likelihood that participation in the Federal Reserve's repo operations could become stigmatized, the possibility that the operations could encourage the Federal Reserve's counterparties to take on excessive liquidity risks in their portfolios, and the potential disintermediation of financial transactions currently undertaken by private counterparties.",0.644852,0.370444
20191030.txt,"Regular, modestly sized repo operations likely would pose relatively little risk of stigma or moral hazard, but they may provide less assurance of control over the federal funds rate because it might be difficult for the Federal Reserve to anticipate money market pressures and scale up its repo operations accordingly.",0.742185,0.450571
20191030.txt,"A standing fixed-rate repo facility would likely provide substantial assurance of control over the federal funds rate, but use of the facility could become stigmatized, particularly if the rate was set at a relatively high level.",0.689298,0.477666
20191030.txt,"Conversely, a standing facility with a rate set at a relatively low level could result in larger and more frequent repo operations than would be appropriate.",0.679667,0.454256

20191030.txt,Some of these participants indicated that a basic principle in implementing an ample-reserves framework is to maintain reserves on an ongoing basis at levels that would obviate the need for open market operations to address pressures in funding markets in all but exceptional circumstances.,0.736916,0.585340
20191030.txt,"Many participants remarked, however, that even in an environment with ample reserves, a standing facility could serve as a useful backstop to support control of the federal funds rate in the event of outsized shocks to the system.",0.667374,0.705970
20191030.txt,"Several of these participants also suggested that, if a standing facility were created that allowed banks to monetize a portion of their securities holdings at times of market stress, banks could possibly reduce their demand for reserves in normal times, which could make it feasible for the monetary policy implementation framework to operate with a significantly smaller quantity of reserves than would otherwise be needed.",0.608950,0.688638

20191030.txt,"Echoing issues raised at the Committee's June 2019 meeting, various participants commented on the need to carefully evaluate these design choices to guard against the potential for moral hazard, stigma, disintermediation risk, or excessive volatility in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.",0.693761,0.510237
20191030.txt,"A couple of other participants suggested that an approach based on modestly sized, frequent repo operations that could be quickly and substantially ramped up in response to emerging market pressures would mitigate the moral hazard, disintermediation, and stigmatization risks associated with a standing repo facility.",0.538855,0.708187

20241107.txt,The staff reviewed developments with respect to the usage of the ON RRP facility.,0.630900,0.267981
20241107.txt,The staff also noted that lowering the ON RRP offering rate 5 basis points would align the ON RRP offering rate with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate and would probably put some downward pressure on other money market rates.,0.471745,0.348921
20241107.txt,The second consideration focused on the possible implications for the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities stemming from the federal debt limit potentially being reinstated in 2025.,0.651075,0.287562
